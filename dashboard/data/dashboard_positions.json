Focusing on landscapes affected by windthrow, insect outbreaks, and wildfire, the research aims to understand how disturbance severity and legacy effects influence long-term forest resilience.\n\nThe MSc student will investigate how disturbance legacies shape regeneration, stand structure, tree growth, and carbon dynamics using a combination of field-based forest surveys, dendrochronology (tree growth analysis), and geospatial tools, including drone-based lidar and satellite remote sensing. The project integrates ecological theory with applied management questions, providing hands-on experience in field ecology, quantitative analysis, and multi-scale disturbance assessment.\n\nQualifications\n\n·        BSc (or expected completion) in forestry, ecology, environmental science, geography, or related field\n\n·        Interest in forest disturbance ecology and climate change\n\n·        Experience with fieldwork in forest ecosystems\n\n·        Strong quantitative skills (R preferred)\n\n·        Experience with GIS or remote sensing is an asset\n\n·       Willingness to work in remote field conditions\n\nFunding\n\nFunding is anticipated at $20,000 for two years, subject to final confirmation. The student will also be encouraged to apply for scholarships (e.g., NSERC CGS-M, UNBC internal scholarships) and teaching assistantships.\n\nWhy UNBC?\n\nUNBC is located in Prince George, the hub of northern British Columbia, offering direct access to diverse forest ecosystems shaped by multiple disturbance regimes. The university is recognized for its strengths in natural resources, forestry, and environmental science. Students benefit from small graduate cohorts, close faculty mentorship, and extensive hands-on field experience. The Natural Resources and Environmental Studies graduate program provides a dynamic hub of students and researchers with a broad range of research interests. Please explore the website for further information: https://www.unbc.ca/nres-graduate-program\n\nPrince George offers an affordable cost of living and outstanding outdoor opportunities, including hiking, skiing, and backcountry access. For students interested in applied forest science and climate change adaptation, UNBC provides an immersive and supportive research environment in a region experiencing real-world forest change.\n\nHow to Apply\n\nPlease email the following as a single PDF to Dr. Violet Zhao violet.zhao@unbc.ca:\n \n·        Brief statement of research interests (1 page max)\n \n·        CV\n \n·        Unofficial transcripts\n \n·       Contact information for two references\n \nReview of applications will continue until the position is filled.

The successful applicant will begin in the Fall 2026 semester.\n\nRio Grande cutthroat trout (RGCT) are the southernmost species of cutthroat trout and have experienced a severe decline in both range and abundance, now occupying only ~12 percent of its historical distribution and requires targeted management interventions to support recovery. Major components of the recovery plan detail the need to secure extant populations and reintroduce individuals within their native range in Colorado and New Mexico. Recent efforts to date include development of a multi-source, genetically diverse broodstock for the Rio Grande basin that is used for reintroduction efforts.\n\nIndividuals from this multi-source broodstock were stocked at multiple sites throughout the recently restored Rio Costilla watershed which represents one of the largest native fish restoration projects in the country. While recent research has shown that this composite broodstock is more genetically diverse compared to using single source populations there is a need to evaluate how these fish are performing in the wild. The present project has a number of goals:\n\n          1. Evaluate genetic structure and diversity of reintroduced Rio Costilla RGCT populations\n                     a. There is also opportunity to develop questions with demographic monitoring data in this system.\n          2. Genetic assessment of Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos basins. \n                     a. Results will help inform multi-source broodstock development for Canadian & Pecos basins and identify additional source populations for Rio Grande basin.\n                     b. Results will also provide an updated genetic assessment for RGCT.\n          3. There are additional opportunities for the student to develop their own questions using genetic and demographic data.\n\nThis project is a collaborative effort funded by the New Mexico Department of Wildlife and there may be potential to collaborate with other university researchers and agencies. Benefits include a salary range of ~$28-29k/year, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance. Funding will also be available for conference travel, workshop training for data analyses, and safety training (e.g., wilderness first aid). The hired candidate will begin in Fall 2026 and will be based at NMSU in Las Cruces, NM.\n\nHow to apply: If interested, please compile the following: (1) a statement of interest that describes your educational and research background, as well as your research interests and how this position fits in your career goals (2) curriculum vitae or resume, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts compiled in a single PDF and save as ‘Lastname_RGCT_PhD.pdf’.

Gerber (https://bgerber123.github.io/) at the Colorado Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and wildlife researchers at Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The graduate research assistantship will cover university tuition, fees, health coverage, and includes a pre-tax monthly pay of $3000/month. The position is expected to start Fall 2026 and be funded through December 2028.\n\nStudy Context: Sex and age class are important demographic parameters used in population modeling, in which the results help guide management decisions and annual harvest quotas of large mammals (e.g., elk, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, mule deer). This work will help develop new methodology and workflows that will aid Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s objective of producing robust empirical demographic data and population estimates for harvested wildlife. \n\nFocus: The focus of this study will be to collect data on the size distribution of elk sex and age classes (cow, calf, bull) to train and test a predictive approach using AI algorithms (developed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife) to classify animals from high-resolution aerial imagery. Field observations and size measurements (via 3D camera) will be collected to help test the accuracy of AI predictions. An additional avenue of exploration may be data collection and AI classification of sex/age class from camera trap images. The student will be expected to develop a project proposal outlining study objectives in coordination with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and a graduate committee at Colorado State University. The student will focus on technological and software workflows to meet study objectives, however, there will likely be field work opportunities as well (e.g., field observations, drone/aerial surveys). Given the trajectory of the wildlife field, the skills gained in this study will likely be desirable for future employers. \n\n Preferred Qualifications: \n\n-          Ungulate field research experience in the intermountain west\n-          Clear interest or experience developing data analysis workflows\n-          Clear interest or experience advancing technological innovation (hardware/software) in wildlife science\n-          Experience deploying camera traps and managing large data sets\n-          Experience with AI algorithms, for example MegaDetector or SpeciesNet\n \nMinimum Qualifications:\n-          A Bachelor of Science degree in wildlife ecology, biology, natural resource management, or related field\n-          A year or more of wildlife related professional research/work experience\n-          Strong writing skills\n-          Strong work ethic \n-          Desire to collaborate with state wildlife management agencies\n\nTo be considered, please send the following materials via email with “AI/Elk Application” as the subject line to Dr. Brian D.

Deschutes County, Oregon represents the northwestern-most extent of the species range and lies far outside the extant range of pinyon pine species. Extensive treatments of juniper woodlands have been expedited throughout western states for restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, sage grouse habitat, and altered fire regimes. However, we lack clear understanding of how these treatments impact PIJA populations.  \n\nManagement priorities for PIJA in Oregon include assessing impacts of juniper treatments on PIJA and determining state-wide distribution. The primary goals of this project are to experimentally study how juniper treatments impact occupancy, habitat use, and nesting of PIJA on BLM lands in Deschutes County, Oregon. We are implementing a before-after-control-impact study and use bioacoustics monitoring, point counts, and nest searching methods. The MS project will focus on at least one component of the project. This work is in partnership with the East Cascades Bird Alliance, US Fish and Wildlife, and Deschutes BLM.

Oregon Tech is on a quarter system. Fall, Winter, and Spring terms are 11 weeks. Our academic year runs from mid-September to Mid-June.  The GTA provides a per-term stipend and partial tuition remission during the academic year (Fall through Spring terms). In addition, this research assistantship will provide additional part-time stipend during the spring term, and full-time hourly salary over the summer. Some travel costs from Klamath Falls to Bend, OR will be covered. The graduate student will be expected to use their own vehicle, preferably one that can handle rugged, rocky roads to access field sites. If the student would prefer to forgo the GTA position and cover their own academic costs, that would be an option. \n\nPOSITION REQUIREMENTS: The candidate should have a Bachelors degree in Natural Resources, Wildlife, Ecology, Environmental Science or a closely related program of study and should meet the requirements for acceptance into the Masters of Natural Resources program at Oregon Tech. Ideally, the applicant will have at least 2 years of field experience studying birds, particularly nest searching and point counts.

The largest research theme within Transforming Climate Action is Reducing Uncertainties in Carbon Cycling in the Northwest Atlantic Seas (Uncertain Seas). The goal of Uncertain Seas is to better constrain the role of the ocean in the Earth’s climate system by reducing uncertainties with physical and biogeochemical processes that control the global ocean carbon cycle. The focus is on the Northwest Atlantic gateway as a major contributor to ocean carbon uptake and sequestration, particularly with respect to the biological carbon pump.\nWe are seeking a PhD Student to estimate carbon fluxes in the Northwest Atlantic from Earth system and ecosystem models. As a part of Transforming Climate Action, there will be opportunities to participate in workshops with other graduate students from the four institutions. There will also be opportunities for research visits to collaborating labs and conference travel. There may be opportunities to participate in research expeditions, although not a requirement.  \n\nLocation: The student will be enrolled in the PhD in Fisheries Science graduate program at the Fisheries & Marine Institute, Memorial University, in St. John’s, NL, Canada.
