The two graduate students will work together and supervise undergraduates in the field and laboratory to \n1. Assess soil physicochemical properties and microbial activities under repeated prescribed fires and forest thinning \n2. Analyze existing, multi-decadal vegetation and litter data to explore plant-soil-microbe interactions in a changing environment \n3. Examine the impact of microplastic pollution on soil nutrients and microbes. \n\nThe hired students are expected to join and lead a three-week field campaign in summer 2026. The team will travel to multiple field sites and research stations in the southeast (AL, GA, NC, SC) to collect and pre-process soil and litter samples. Samples will be brought or shipped back to AU for further laboratory analysis. Students are welcome to build their projects within the scope of soil health and nutrient cycling.  \n Responsibilities \n1. Conduct literature reviews and learn/develop experimental protocols \n2. Attend weekly or biweekly lab meetings to share updates and give comments \n3. Generate, organize, and analyze data \n4. Write and publish manuscripts in peer-reviewed scientific journals \n5. Present research findings at local, national, and international conferences \n Minimum Qualifications \n1. BS degree in Forestry, Ecology, Environmental Science, Natural Resources, or a related field; MS degree is required if applying for PhD \n2.

Valid driver's license (or ability to obtain one in several months) \n Estimated Start Date and Stipend \nPhD student, January 2026, $26,500 per year + tuition remission and benefits \nMS student, June 2026, $23,500 per year + tuition remission and benefits \nFinancial support is typically provided for four years for PhD and two years for MS, subject to annual evaluation.  \n About Forest Soils and Biogeochemistry Lab \nResearch in the Forest Soils and Biogeochemistry Lab investigates the fate of carbon and other elements in forest soil and its surrounding environment to address soil conservation issues and develop sustainable practices. We integrate field measurements, laboratory experiments, and computational statistics to examine soil biogeochemical responses under warmer climate, shifted precipitation regimes, and disturbances in forest ecosystems. The lab consists of a main laboratory room, a soil texture room, two storage rooms with field equipment, and a shared walk-in refrigerator. The main laboratory room houses a Biological Digital Microscope, a Deionized Water System, a Shimadzu Total Organic Carbon Analyzer, an Electronic Thermostat Hova-Bator Incubator, an Isotemp Programmable Muffle Furnace, a Chloroform fumigation-extraction station, and a brand-new FlashSmart Elemental Analyzer.\n\nVisit Dr. Yang’s profile to learn more about the lab and research activities. Information regarding PhD and MS programs in the college of Forestry, Wildlife and Environment can be found at https://cfwe.auburn.edu/graduate-study/graduate-degrees/. \n To Apply\nPlease email the following materials as a single PDF document to Dr. Yang Yang at yangy@auburn.edu, with the subject line “Potential Graduate Student at AU.” \n1.

The largest research theme within Transforming Climate Action is Reducing Uncertainties in Carbon Cycling in the Northwest Atlantic Seas (Uncertain Seas). The goal of Uncertain Seas is to better constrain the role of the ocean in the Earth’s climate system by reducing uncertainties with physical and biogeochemical processes that control the global ocean carbon cycle. The focus is on the Northwest Atlantic gateway as a major contributor to ocean carbon uptake and sequestration, particularly with respect to the biological carbon pump.\nWe are seeking a PhD Student to estimate carbon fluxes in the Northwest Atlantic from Earth system and ecosystem models.

There will also be opportunities for research visits to collaborating labs and conference travel. There may be opportunities to participate in research expeditions, although not a requirement.  \n\nLocation: The student will be enrolled in the PhD in Fisheries Science graduate program at the Fisheries & Marine Institute, Memorial University, in St. John’s, NL, Canada.  Memorial University is a hub of ocean sciences located in the Province’s capital.

    "description": "Graduate Assistantship at WVU: Aquatic Species Responses to Changing River Conditions\nAquatic lab- West Virginia University (Private)\nDetails\nApplication Deadline:\n04/01/2026\nPublished:\n02/13/2026\nStarting Date:\n8/17/2026\nHours per Week:\nat least 40\nSalary:\n$21,000 to $27,000 per year\nEducation Required:\nBachelors\nExperience Required:\nat least 2 years\nLocation:\nWest Virginia University (Morgantown, West Virginia)\nTags:\nGraduate Opportunities\nDescription\nThe Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Design at West Virginia University, through Dr. Carol Arantes’s lab, is recruiting a Master’s or PhD student to begin in Fall 2026 to study how changes in river conditions affect aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity. \n\nThe student will be part of a collaborative, interdisciplinary project examining how global hydraulic infrastructure and river management over the past century have altered river discharge regimes and aquatic ecosystems, and how uncertainty in reconstructed historical records affects confidence in global assessments of river change. Working within a multi-institutional research team, the student will collaborate closely with a modeling group to develop and apply new models and indicators of river processes that integrate hydrologic alteration, river fragmentation, sediment transport, river temperature, and patterns of fish diversity and abundance. \n\nThe student will work closely with the PI, postdoctoral researchers, and a multi-institutional team of project partners to integrate ecological data with large-scale environmental and infrastructure datasets. Expected outcomes include peer-reviewed publications, technical reports, and presentations for both scientific and non-scientific audiences. The position offers strong training opportunities in quantitative analysis, interdisciplinary research, and professional development. \n\nQualifications \nApplicants must hold a B.S. or M.S. degree in ecology, fisheries, zoology, aquatic sciences, or a closely related field, with a minimum GPA of 3.0/4.0. Successful candidates will demonstrate strong written and oral communication skills, solid analytical abilities, and the capacity to work independently and collaboratively. Experience or strong interest in fish and aquatic ecology is required. Experience with or interest in computer modeling, statistical analysis (Bayesian and/or frequentist approaches), and GIS is highly desirable. \n\n Funding:\nThe selected student will be supported through a combination of Teaching Assistantships (TAships) and Research Assistantships (RAships), for a total of three years of funding.\n\nM.S. students will receive a stipend of $21,000 per year plus a full tuition waiver.\n\nPh.D. students will receive 9 months of funding per year plus a full tuition waiver, with opportunities for additional summer salary contingent upon successful completion of stream surveys and project fieldwork.\n\n How to Apply\nInterested students should email the following materials as a single PDF directly to:\nDr. Carol Arantes\ncaroline.arantes@mail.wvu.edu \n\nApplication materials should include: \n\nA brief cover letter describing research background, interests, career goals, and motivation for pursuing an MS or PhD\nA current CV or résumé\nNames and contact information for three professional references\nUnofficial transcripts and GRE scores (if available)\n\n Please do not submit materials to the WVU Graduate School at this stage.\n\nAdditional Information\n Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Design\n https://www.davis.wvu.edu/\nSchool of Natural Resources and the Environment\nhttps://www.davis.wvu.edu/schools/natural-resources-and-the-environment\nDr. Arantes’s lab\nhttps://www.davis.wvu.edu/faculty-staff/directory/carol-arantes\nhttps://aranteslab.weebly.com/ \n\n \n\n\n  Contact\nCaroline C.
