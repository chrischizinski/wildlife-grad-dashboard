Description
RIO GRANDE CUTTHROAT TROUT PHD ASSISTANTSHIP

Description & project background: 

The Pregler Lab at New Mexico State University in the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Ecology invites applications for a PhD research assistantship focused on Rio Grande cutthroat trout conservation. The successful applicant will begin in the Fall 2026 semester.

Rio Grande cutthroat trout (RGCT) are the southernmost species of cutthroat trout and have experienced a severe decline in both range and abundance, now occupying only ~12 percent of its historical distribution and requires targeted management interventions to support recovery. Major components of the recovery plan detail the need to secure extant populations and reintroduce individuals within their native range in Colorado and New Mexico. Recent efforts to date include development of a multi-source, genetically diverse broodstock for the Rio Grande basin that is used for reintroduction efforts.

Individuals from this multi-source broodstock were stocked at multiple sites throughout the recently restored Rio Costilla watershed which represents one of the largest native fish restoration projects in the country. While recent research has shown that this composite broodstock is more genetically diverse compared to using single source populations there is a need to evaluate how these fish are performing in the wild. The present project has a number of goals:

          1. Evaluate genetic structure and diversity of reintroduced Rio Costilla RGCT populations
                     a. There is also opportunity to develop questions with demographic monitoring data in this system.
          2. Genetic assessment of Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos basins. 
                     a. Results will help inform multi-source broodstock development for Canadian & Pecos basins and identify additional source populations for Rio Grande basin.
                     b. Results will also provide an updated genetic assessment for RGCT.
          3. There are additional opportunities for the student to develop their own questions using genetic and demographic data.

This project is a collaborative effort funded by the New Mexico Department of Wildlife and there may be potential to collaborate with other university researchers and agencies. Benefits include a salary range of ~$28-29k/year, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance. Funding will also be available for conference travel, workshop training for data analyses, and safety training (e.g., wilderness first aid). The hired candidate will begin in Fall 2026 and will be based at NMSU in Las Cruces, NM.

How to apply: If interested, please compile the following: (1) a statement of interest that describes your educational and research background, as well as your research interests and how this position fits in your career goals (2) curriculum vitae or resume, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts compiled in a single PDF and save as ‘Lastname_RGCT_PhD.pdf’.  Applicants are also asked to upload a writing sample in the application portal. Applications should be submitted through the airtable linked here:  https://airtable.com/app3jNqbQZsYstwx7/pagrpU5GqaI6FnSTg/form

Description
A graduate assistantship for a master’s student is expected to be funded at Colorado State University (Fort Collins, CO) working with Dr. Brian D. Gerber (https://bgerber123.github.io/) at the Colorado Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and wildlife researchers at Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The graduate research assistantship will cover university tuition, fees, health coverage, and includes a pre-tax monthly pay of $3000/month. The position is expected to start Fall 2026 and be funded through December 2028.

Study Context: Sex and age class are important demographic parameters used in population modeling, in which the results help guide management decisions and annual harvest quotas of large mammals (e.g., elk, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, mule deer). This work will help develop new methodology and workflows that will aid Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s objective of producing robust empirical demographic data and population estimates for harvested wildlife. 

Focus: The focus of this study will be to collect data on the size distribution of elk sex and age classes (cow, calf, bull) to train and test a predictive approach using AI algorithms (developed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife) to classify animals from high-resolution aerial imagery. Field observations and size measurements (via 3D camera) will be collected to help test the accuracy of AI predictions. An additional avenue of exploration may be data collection and AI classification of sex/age class from camera trap images. The student will be expected to develop a project proposal outlining study objectives in coordination with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and a graduate committee at Colorado State University. The student will focus on technological and software workflows to meet study objectives, however, there will likely be field work opportunities as well (e.g., field observations, drone/aerial surveys). Given the trajectory of the wildlife field, the skills gained in this study will likely be desirable for future employers. 

 Preferred Qualifications: 

-          Ungulate field research experience in the intermountain west
-          Clear interest or experience developing data analysis workflows
-          Clear interest or experience advancing technological innovation (hardware/software) in wildlife science
-          Experience deploying camera traps and managing large data sets
-          Experience with AI algorithms, for example MegaDetector or SpeciesNet
 
Minimum Qualifications:
-          A Bachelor of Science degree in wildlife ecology, biology, natural resource management, or related field
-          A year or more of wildlife related professional research/work experience
-          Strong writing skills
-          Strong work ethic 
-          Desire to collaborate with state wildlife management agencies

To be considered, please send the following materials via email with “AI/Elk Application” as the subject line to Dr. Brian D. Gerber (brian.gerber@colostate.edu) by March 2, 2026: 1) Cover letter outlining career goals, academic interests, and relevant experience related to the minimum and preferred qualifications, 2) resume with contact information for 3-4 personal references, and unofficial copy of B.S. transcripts.

Description
The Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Design at West Virginia University, through Dr. Carol Arantes’s lab, is recruiting a Master’s or PhD student to begin in Fall 2026 to study how changes in river conditions affect aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity. 

The student will be part of a collaborative, interdisciplinary project examining how global hydraulic infrastructure and river management over the past century have altered river discharge regimes and aquatic ecosystems, and how uncertainty in reconstructed historical records affects confidence in global assessments of river change. Working within a multi-institutional research team, the student will collaborate closely with a modeling group to develop and apply new models and indicators of river processes that integrate hydrologic alteration, river fragmentation, sediment transport, river temperature, and patterns of fish diversity and abundance. 

The student will work closely with the PI, postdoctoral researchers, and a multi-institutional team of project partners to integrate ecological data with large-scale environmental and infrastructure datasets. Expected outcomes include peer-reviewed publications, technical reports, and presentations for both scientific and non-scientific audiences. The position offers strong training opportunities in quantitative analysis, interdisciplinary research, and professional development. 

Qualifications 
Applicants must hold a B.S. or M.S. degree in ecology, fisheries, zoology, aquatic sciences, or a closely related field, with a minimum GPA of 3.0/4.0. Successful candidates will demonstrate strong written and oral communication skills, solid analytical abilities, and the capacity to work independently and collaboratively. Experience or strong interest in fish and aquatic ecology is required. Experience with or interest in computer modeling, statistical analysis (Bayesian and/or frequentist approaches), and GIS is highly desirable. 

 Funding:
The selected student will be supported through a combination of Teaching Assistantships (TAships) and Research Assistantships (RAships), for a total of three years of funding.

M.S. students will receive a stipend of $21,000 per year plus a full tuition waiver.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: Aspergillus flavus, a common pathogen of maize globally, is especially problematic in the southeastern region of the United States. It causes ear-rot and contaminates grain with aflatoxin, a highly carcinogenic mycotoxin. Susceptibility to A. flavus infection and aflatoxin accumulation is exacerbated in the presence of biotic and abiotic stresses that commonly occur in corn production environments. Since inheritance of resistance to Aspergillus ear rot is controlled by many QTL across the genome, innovative research will be required to develop and deploy commercially valuable hybrids possessing stable resistance. The fellow will be involved in a research project to

Screen and characterize maize germplasm from different sources to identify germplasm with resistance to Aspergillus flavus kernel infection and subsequent aflatoxin accumulation;
Incorporate resistance to A. flavus into agronomically acceptable maize inbred lines with improved combining ability for yield, and alignment with industry heterotic patterns; and
Discover maize inbred lines that are resilient to extreme weather events and more productive under sustainable management systems.
Learning Objectives: The participant will gain skills in laboratory methodologies, experimental design, maize breeding, and data analysis. Through the course of the project, the participant will gain knowledge of current issues and latest research at the intersection of maize pathology and breeding with a focus on Aspergillus ear rot disease through exposure to the lab's researchers, as well as academic and industry collaborators.

Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Ebrahiem Babiker (ebrahiem.babiker@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: April 6, 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $6,223.16 - $7,459.00 monthly.

Description
ROJECT TITLE: Pinyon Jay response to juniper management, Deschutes County, Oregon.

BACKGROUND: Pinyon Jays (PIJA, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) have experienced significant, range-wide declines over the past 50 years, and are currently under Status Review for ESA listing. Deschutes County, Oregon represents the northwestern-most extent of the species range and lies far outside the extant range of pinyon pine species. Extensive treatments of juniper woodlands have been expedited throughout western states for restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, sage grouse habitat, and altered fire regimes. However, we lack clear understanding of how these treatments impact PIJA populations.  

Management priorities for PIJA in Oregon include assessing impacts of juniper treatments on PIJA and determining state-wide distribution. The primary goals of this project are to experimentally study how juniper treatments impact occupancy, habitat use, and nesting of PIJA on BLM lands in Deschutes County, Oregon. We are implementing a before-after-control-impact study and use bioacoustics monitoring, point counts, and nest searching methods. The MS project will focus on at least one component of the project. This work is in partnership with the East Cascades Bird Alliance, US Fish and Wildlife, and Deschutes BLM. We also contribute to the PIJA Western Working Group and the PIJA Conservation Action Strategy (CAS). The MS candidate will be expected to coordinate with and contribute findings to larger range-wide intiatives. 

LOCATION & PROGRAM: This position supports a student in the Masters of Science in Natural Resources at Oregon Tech in Klamath Falls, OR. Our MS program started in 2024 and is in the Natural Sciences Department, which also encompasses the MS of Medical Science program, and BS programs in Environmental Science and Biology-Health Science. Program description and requirements are here https://www.oit.edu/academics/degrees/natural-resources 

SUPPORT: This position includes the opportunity for a Graduate Teaching Assistantship for the Academic Years 2026-2026 and 2027-2028. The GTA will teach labs in the 200-level Principles of Biology series for majors, &/or similar courses within the students expertise. GTAs cover two 3-hour sections per term. Oregon Tech is on a quarter system. Fall, Winter, and Spring terms are 11 weeks. Our academic year runs from mid-September to Mid-June.  The GTA provides a per-term stipend and partial tuition remission during the academic year (Fall through Spring terms). In addition, this research assistantship will provide additional part-time stipend during the spring term, and full-time hourly salary over the summer. Some travel costs from Klamath Falls to Bend, OR will be covered. The graduate student will be expected to use their own vehicle, preferably one that can handle rugged, rocky roads to access field sites. If the student would prefer to forgo the GTA position and cover their own academic costs, that would be an option. 

POSITION REQUIREMENTS: The candidate should have a Bachelors degree in Natural Resources, Wildlife, Ecology, Environmental Science or a closely related program of study and should meet the requirements for acceptance into the Masters of Natural Resources program at Oregon Tech. Ideally, the applicant will have at least 2 years of field experience studying birds, particularly nest searching and point counts. Experience with bioacoustics monitoring (ARUs, BirdNET) will be especially helpful. Additionally, experience doing habitat analyses (Occupancy modeling, RSFs, SDMs) using program R and GIS will be very valuable.  The candidate should have proven ability to work independently in remote areas, and as a member of a team, including supervising undergraduates and working with volunteers. 

 

DATES: Start date is flexible. We are beginning the greater project design and implementation this winter 2026, therefore, the candidate could start as early as March, 2026 as a temporary hire. The academic year begins in mid-September, 2026. 

LOCATION: Oregon Tech is in Klamath Falls, OR, a small rural region of south-central Oregon. The field research about 3 hours north, near Bend and Sisters, Oregon in the east Cascades, sage-steppe biome.

Research Project: The Emerging Pests and Pathogens Research Unit (EPPRU) is seeking a motivated Post Doctoral fellow to participate in a multi-disciplinary research program focused on the molecular biology of plant pathogenic bacteria. Projects within this research unit are generally aimed at solving questions related to the biology of plant pathogens and cover a range of applied and fundamental research topics. The research opportunities for this postdoc will be centered around investigating a new source of genetic disease resistance in potatoes. This resistance trait was identified and mapped in Solanum microdontum (Mcd) by its ability to protect tubers from bacterial soft rot disease.  There are three important questions that need to be addressed to prepare the germplasm for use in applied breeding programs:

Does Mcd resistance provide protection from other potato pathogens;
Does Mcd resistance provide protection to stems, leaves, and other tissues;
What genes are responsible for Mcd resistance. 
For additional background about this project see: doi: 10.1094/PHYTO-05-23-0158-R and doi: 10.1007/s12230-021-09859-8.

Position Description
The Collaborative Conservation & Adaptation Planning and the Wetland and Riparian Ecology labs at Auburn University are seeking a full-time Postdoctoral Research Fellow to join the “Building the resilience of Gulf Coast blue economies in a changing world: A multiple case study” research initiative, which has been recommended for funding by Mississippi Alabama Sea Grant (*this post was made in anticipation of receiving final approval from the NOAA grants office). This mixed-methods project will constructively evaluate the long-term impacts of Sea Grant’s Gulf Resilience Community of Practice (CoP) and explore how resilience is understood, experienced, and implemented across a spectrum of coastal economies in Mississippi and Alabama.

The postdoc will work closely with Dr. Matthew Jurjonas (PI and Assistant Professor, Conservation Social Science) and Dr. Chris Anderson (Co-PI and Professor, Coastal Wetland Ecology) to co-lead project implementation. The position emphasizes community-based fieldwork, qualitative interviewing, focus groups, and comparative case study analysis, with three focal communities who have already expressed support for the project—representing a range of traditional, hybrid, and tourism-based blue economies. In addition, this position will help co-design a workshop at the CoP annual meeting designed to share results, foster dialogue, and strategize new directions for today’s changing coastal resilience context toward the end of the project.

The position will start in the Spring 2026, and the starting salary is $55,000. In addition, the position includes an annual research and travel budget to support fieldwork, professional development, and dissemination activities.

Key Responsibilities
Develop and implement a program evaluation protocol that constructively evaluates the impact, potential opportunities, and future directions of the Resilience CoP.  
Collaboratively refine and implement a robust qualitative multiple case study design based on Yin’s methodology in three Gulf Coast Communities
Yin, R. K. (2018). Case study research and applications (Vol. 6). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.
Facilitate ongoing coordination with Resilience Extensionists and Gulf Resilience CoP members.
Support the design and implementation of a co-produced workshop hosted in conjunction with the Gulf Resilience CoP annual meeting.
Contribute to the development of peer-reviewed publications, a practitioner-focused policy brief, and outreach materials.
Participate in regular team meetings, project planning, and stakeholder engagement.
Present findings at national and regional conferences (e.g., Gulf of America Alliance, Social Coast Forum, International Association for Society and Natural Resources).

Qualifications
Required:
PhD in Environmental Social Science, Human Dimensions, Geography, Sociology, Public Policy, or a related field by the start date.
Demonstrated experience conducting qualitative research (e.g., interviews, coding, case study design).
Strong writing skills with a track record of scholarly publication.
Interest in community resilience, adaptation, and coastal blue economies.
Experience working with diverse partners, including government agencies, extension, and NGOs.
Interest in contributing to the CCAP lab’s culture of collaborative community-engaged science. 
Preferred:
