The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: The US National Poultry Research Center (USNPRC) is seeking a postdoctoral fellow to investigate the complex molecular interactions between Infectious Laryngotracheitis Virus (ILTV) and the host immune system. As an alphaherpesvirus, ILTV causes significant economic losses worldwide through respiratory distress and decreased production in poultry. This research specifically focuses on the characterization of virus-encoded immunoregulatory proteins, known as virokines, which serve as evolved mechanisms allowing the virus to subvert or evade the host’s innate and adaptive immune responses. By utilizing synthetic biology and reverse genetics, the participant will dissect the function of these proteins to identify targets for attenuation, ultimately leveraging these insights to engineer next-generation vaccine candidates using viral-vector platforms to bridge the gap between fundamental virology and applied veterinary medicine.

Research activities will include the characterization of novel ILTV-encoded virokines to determine their specific cellular targets within the avian immune system and develop novel vaccines. The fellow will determine the role of these immunomodulatory proteins in viral replication and pathogenesis using both in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, the project involves utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 and recombineering to generate mutant viruses lacking specific virokines to assess their potential as live-attenuated vaccine candidates. To ensure rigorous evaluation, the participant will establish standardized immunological assays to define the correlates of protection, focusing on both mucosal and systemic cellular responses. Finally, the project culminates in the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of these candidate vaccines within BSL-2 animal facilities.

Learning Objectives: 

The participant will gain advanced technical expertise in synthetic biology and the genetic manipulation of large DNA viruses.
The fellow will receive hands-on training in cutting-edge vaccine development
The program offers unique experience in conducting high-containment research within BSL-2 laboratory environments.
Participants will develop proficiency in multi-parameter flow cytometry and specialized immunological assays to measure avian-specific immune correlates.
