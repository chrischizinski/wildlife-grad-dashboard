MSc, predictive phenomics to improve oyster aquaculture 

Department of Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Science, Coastal Oregon Marine Experiment Station, Oregon State University, Newport, Oregon

We are seeking one graduate student (MS) to work in collaboration with academic and federal partners to determine early predictive traits of product success. This project will leverage an ongoing selective breeding program of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. 

Predictive phenotyping or ‘phenomics’ seeks to improve efficiency with which desirable traits (i.e. survival, biotic/abiotic tolerance, etc.) are detected, as grow-out using standard cultivation methods is both labor and time intensive.  Streamlining discrimination of advantageous traits can accelerate and economize the progress of aquaculture breeding programs.

The student will execute experiments in a functional oyster hatchery and collect specimens to quantify catalysts, metabolites, and products of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in whole organisms and homogenized tissues. Facilitated by mentorship of the academic advisor, the student will be responsible for data management and analysis (using open-source notebook and data repositories), biannual presentation of project progress and findings at industry-centered conferences, and submission for peer-reviewed publication. 

A general background in cellular biology and bioenergetics is required. Candidates with prior benchwork, research, and/or commercial industry experience (oyster farm, hatchery, etc.) are preferred. 

A tentative start date for winter term 2026 advised by Dr. Samuel Gurr.

Required Qualifications: 

- B.S. in biology, marine science, aquaculture, or related field

- GPA minimum 3.0 (>3.5 preferred)

- Enthusiastic, motivated, and self-sufficient

- Strong verbal and written communication skills 

- Experience in basic laboratory techniques, good organizational skills, and attention to detail 

- Ability to work independently and as a productive member of a research team 

Preferred Qualifications: 

- Experience in both sterile benchwork and wet lab environments for the handling and processing of biological samples 

- Adept in following, troubleshooting, and writing iterative standard operating procedures for complex tasks

- Experience programming in R (data carpentry, statistics, visualization)

- Experience using version control systems for data management

- Background or interest in selective breeding, energetics, and evolutionary genetics

- Experience working in/or communicating with aquaculture industry 


Start Date: Winter or Fall 2026 

Application Deadline: open until filled

To Apply: Please send the following materials via email to Samuel Gurr (samuel.gurr@oregonstate.edu) 

(1) Cover letter describing qualifications, career goals, and academic interests

(2) CV with contact information for three references

Description
The Laverty Lab in the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Ecology and the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences at New Mexico State University invites applications for a Ph.D. position supported by research and teaching assistantships. The successful applicant will be hired as a graduate student position beginning in January 2026.

This project will be focused on assessing the roles of temporary water sources—playas (i.e., ephemeral lake beds), tinajas (i.e., natural bedrock depressions that are spring- or precipitation-fed), etc.—on structuring aerial vertebrate communities in the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts using acoustic monitoring. While the distribution of aquatic organisms is tightly associated with water features, terrestrial species may only visit water a few times each week to drink or hunt for prey. Among terrestrial vertebrates, highly mobile, aerial species (i.e., bats and birds) may provide information on the quality of individual water sources as well as the use of and connectivity among dispersed sources. Many bats and birds remain active in the Southwest year-round where the role of highly ephemeral water sources in structuring their communities is only somewhat understood. Activity of these aerial vertebrates at times when playas or tinajas lack water can reveal insights into the function of these sites beyond water drinking and may inform how a species would be expected to respond under a changing climate. The student will develop exciting questions investigating how bat (and potentially bird) activity and diversity interact with ephemeral water sources in desert landscapes.

This project is funded through a combination of graduate research assistantships supported by the National Science Foundation’s Long-Term Ecological Research program and the National Park Service’s Southwest Border Resource Protection Program as well as teaching assistantships in the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Ecology. Research will involve collaborative efforts with other university researchers and state/federal agencies. Benefits include an annual salary range of $28,384.56 – $29,698.32, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance.

Qualifications:
Required: B.S. in wildlife science, biology, conservation ecology, or related field. As you may work on a U.S. military base and make research trips to Sonora, applicants must be a U.S. citizen and possess a valid U.S. driver’s license and valid passport. The successful applicant must also meet the minimum requirements for admission to the NMSU Graduate School (minimum 3.00 GPA). Applicants should also have demonstrated excellent written and oral communication skills, and an ability to work independently. Applicants should have experience working in the backcountry and are willing to lead field crews in rugged, desert terrain in the Jornada Basin (New Mexico) and areas in/adjacent to Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument (Arizona), including El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve (Mexico).

Preference may be given to applicants with an M.S. degree in wildlife science, biology, conservation ecology, or related field and with a GPA of 3.30 or higher. Successful candidates will have experience working in R, an interest in acoustic ecology, and working with large datasets. They should also demonstrate the ability to work as part of a team and have a willingness to lead field work crews. Applicants with experience in processing acoustic data and statistical analyses are encouraged to apply.

The Laverty Lab is committed to providing a place of work and learning free from discrimination and harassment and encourages applicants from diverse backgrounds.

How to apply:
For consideration, please submit your application using the form on the following link: https://airtable.com/app22ZC66GEtCTx19/shruXqT6iFNwLazdy

Description
MSc/PhD Assistantship Conservation Genomics and documentation of snake fungal disease in Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake, Timber Rattlesnake, and Plain-bellied Watersnake 
 Department of Natural Resource Ecology and Management, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa 
 We are seeking one graduate student (MS or PhD) to work in collaboration with partners investigating the conservation genomics of three snake species of conservation concern and documenting the occurrence of snake fungal disease (SFD) in the Upper Midwest. The PIs are equally interested in either MS or PhD candidates for this position and preference will be given to the most qualified candidates seeking either degree. This project will facilitate collaborative conservation of at-risk snakes in three Midwestern states (Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin).  
 Habitat loss, population isolation, persecution, and wildlife disease are considered the major threats to snake populations.  Development of the landscape for intensive human use beginning in the 19th century (e.g., expansive agricultural and urban development) fragmented and isolated wildlife populations, especially species with limited dispersal abilities such as snakes. More recently many snake species have been threatened by an emerging disease caused by a fungal (Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola) infection (Snake Fungal Disease; SFD).  This combination of threats continues to impact snake populations in the Midwest.  The species targeted in this project are each considered at-risk in one or more of the partnering states.  
 The student will be responsible for collecting samples in Iowa with state partners and coordinating the transfer of archived samples from other states to Iowa State University, working with samples in the lab to extract DNA and test for fungal infection, as well as the management of samples, DNA, resultant data, and the analyses of the data. 
 Training on handling venomous snakes and collecting samples will be provided if the selected candidate does not have experience. 
 The student will begin by January 2026 and will be co-advised by Dr. Julie Blanchong and Dr. Kevin Roe. 
 Required Qualifications: 
- B.S. in wildlife science, ecology, zoology, or closely related field 
- GPA of 3.0
