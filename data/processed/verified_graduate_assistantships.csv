Graduate Opportunities
Description
Indiana State University Department of Biology is seeking graduate applications (PhD preferred) from highly motivated and capable students to study water snake ecology (diamondback, copperbelly, and common water snakes). This position’s research will build off of a current MS water snake project at Indiana State University.
 A position fully supported by a teaching assistantship (2 years for MS, 5 years for PhD; $13,500 + tuition waiver) will be available starting January 2026. Additional summer assistantships may be available.
 There is opportunity for highly motivated and capable students to develop their own projects based on their interests and skills. Other current lab projects include comparing non-invasive monitoring methods, raccoon parasites, and analysis of stress hormones and ecological contaminants in bats and large carnivores. Graduate research projects can combine traditional field ecology studies with techniques and technology such as ecotoxicology, hormone analysis, GIS habitat analysis, mark-recapture, telemetry, and/or genetics/genomics.  Field-based data collection is typically conducted during the summer and laboratory work can be conducted throughout the year.  Fieldwork may involve canoeing/boating, mud, bugs, heat, handling animals, and other strenuous dirty-job type work (generally need to be able to lift ~50lbs).

Description
An MS assistantship is available starting Spring 2026 in the Department of Crop, Soil & Environmental Sciences at Auburn University. These positions are part of an interdisciplinary research project investigating wetland hydrology and biogeochemistry, focusing on innovative approaches to detect hydric soils in challenging environments. We seek highly motivated students to join our team, contributing to impactful research supporting wetland conservation and restoration under the USDA-NRCS Wetland Reserve Easement (WRE) program.

Project Rationale: Wetlands are critical ecosystems that regulate water quality, store carbon, and provide habitats for diverse species. However, detecting hydric soils—especially in smectitic soils—can be challenging due to a lack of traditional field indicators such as iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) oxides. This project seeks to address this gap by employing Indicators of Reduction in Soils (IRIS) devices, which monitor anaerobic conditions through Fe and Mn oxide coating removal. This research has significant implications for enhancing wetland identification and ensuring more accurate wetland restoration under the WRE program.

Project Objectives:

IRIS Film Implementation: Test the effectiveness of IRIS films in detecting anaerobic soil conditions in smectitic soils.
Soil Morphology and Biogeochemistry Linkages: Correlate IRIS results with changes in soil morphology, hydrology, and biogeochemical properties of problematic soils.
Field Evaluation of Rhizosphere Cameras: Compare field performance of IRIS rhizosphere cameras with standard IRIS film results.
Protocol Development: Utilize Mn coating removal data and time-of-saturation measurements to develop a tailored IRIS protocol for smectitic soils.

Minimum qualifications:

Bachelor's or Master's degree in Soil Science, Hydrology, Environmental Science, or a closely related field.
Strong writing and communication skills.
Proficiency in R or Python for data analysis and modeling.
A valid US driver’s license for field site visits.

Desired qualifications:

Background in wetland soils, biogeochemistry, and soil hydrology.
Experience with machine learning and image processing in R.
Strong statistical skills, including time series analysis.
Experience in hydrological modeling (e.g., Hydrus).
Additional expertise in digital soil mapping and soil morphology is a plus.
For questions, please email Dr. Thorsten Knappenberger (knappi@auburn.edu) or
Dr. Yaniv Olshansky (yzo0015@auburn.edu).

Description
 ARS Office/Lab and Location: A postdoctoral research opportunity is available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Center for Grain and Animal Health Research and Arthropod-borne Animal Diseases Research Unit (ABADRU) in Manhattan, Kansas.  

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

The SCINet/Big Data Research Participation Program of the USDA ARS offers research opportunities to motivated postdoctoral fellows interested in solving agriculture-related problems at a range of spatial and temporal scales, from the genome to the continent, and sub-daily to evolutionary time scales. One of the goals of the SCINet Initiative is to develop and apply new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, to help solve complex agricultural problems that also depend on collaboration across scientific disciplines and geographic locations. In addition, many of these technologies rely on the synthesis, integration, and analysis of large, diverse datasets that benefit from high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. The objective of these fellowships is to facilitate cross-disciplinary, cross-location research through collaborative research on problems of interest to each applicant and amenable to or requiring the HPC environment. Training will be provided in data science, scientific computing, AI/machine learning, and related topics as needed for the fellow to complete their research. Additional funds are available for supplies and travel essential for the fellow's research.

Research Project: Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will research towards developing iterative forecasts for the spread of a viral arthropod-borne livestock disease from Mexico into the United States. Vesicular Stomatitis (VS) has a complex ecology with multiple vector species, host species, and a wide geographic range, occurring every year in southern Mexico and semi-periodically spreading northwards to cause outbreaks in the western US. We lack timely forecasts of direction and rate of disease spread during an outbreak event.  

Modeling approaches will feature process-based machine learning in high-performance computing (HPC) environments and include data assimilation techniques in a Bayesian framework. Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will identify and integrate multiple data streams into the model framework, including host and vector distributions, confirmed georeferenced reports of VS cases in the United States and Mexico, and publicly available environmental layers derived from satellites, observational networks, and reanalysis products.  

The forecasting model time lag will be paired with the time periods needed for impactful management activity (e.g., increased livestock monitoring, vector surveillance, animal movement and quarantines) at relevant spatial scales. The participant will collaboratively produce forecasts of VS disease emergence and spread meant to be updated iteratively over the outbreak season, with explicit quantification of forecast uncertainty. Findings from this project can be applied to other arthropod-borne disease systems. The participant will also have the opportunity to contribute open and reproducible high-performance computational workflows to the ARS SCINet and AI Center of Excellence (scinet.usda.gov) communities. 

Learning Objectives: The participant will learn about developing stakeholder-driven models of livestock disease spread that are widely applicable to a broad range of systems. The participant will also have the opportunity to take online courses and other trainings in coding (e.g., R, Python, HPC) and scientific topics, and to hone interdisciplinary communication, collaboration, and leadership skills through workshop and working group experiences.  

USDA-ARS Contact: If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact Dr. Amy Hudson at amy.hudson@usda.gov. 

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: Start date is flexible, anticipated in January 2026. 

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be renewed for a second year upon recommendation of the mentor and ARS. 

Level of Participation: The appointment is full-time. 

Participant Stipend: The participant(s) will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The current stipend range for this opportunity is $90,000 - $100,000/year plus a supplement to offset a health insurance premium. 

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR).

Description
 *Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNWRS) located in Hilo, Hawaii.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: Natural ecosystems are becoming homogenized by the introduction and establishment of non-native species.  Our study area, the lowland wet forests (LWF) of Hawai‘i, have been subject to high rates of invasion due to geography and human colonization.  However, non-native species removal is expensive and time-consuming, and some non-native species may be playing important roles in the community by providing ecosystem goods and services. The Liko Na Pilina Project seeks to develop a strategy utilizing the functional traits of plants to purposefully create new ecosystems that maintain themselves with relatively little input, and that are capable of sequestering substantial amounts of carbon, sustaining a broad range of native biological diversity, and staying open enough at ground level to allow human movement through them. Our overall objective is to develop and evaluate a set of what we call “hybrid ecosystems,” in which a mix of native and non-native species maintains valuable forest structure and ecosystem services. The participant will support this Liko Na Pilina restoration experiment and be mentored as part of a collaborative team of the USDA Forest Service, University of Hawaii at Hilo, and the Hawaii Army National Guard. 

The participant will be involved with field data collections, field research plot maintenance, greenhouse planting, laboratory sample processing, and data entry. Field data collections are focused on:

Collecting data on tree growth and survival, seed production, litterfall, and phenology;
Conducting regular plot maintenance (weeding and herbicide application), and;
Planting desirable species mixes into target restoration areas across the larger landscape.
Greenhouse plantings will focus on:

Propagation of desirable plants of future restoration efforts, and;
General upkeep of the greenhouse space. 
Laboratory sample processing will focus on: post-processing (i.e., sorting and weighing) litterfall/seed rain samples. Data entry will focus on entering data collected in the field and lab into ongoing data sets.

Field conditions can be hot or rainy. Terrain is very uneven as plots are located on 'a'a lava substrates. Day to day activities of the participant will involve hiking and standing and may include lifting containers weighing up to 35 pounds. 

Learning Objectives: The fellow will build knowledge, experience, and competence in the following areas:

Plant identification and vegetation monitoring techniques
Applied hands-on restoration strategies
Plant propagation technique for species with diverse needs
Standard ecological sample processing protocols 
Data entry, management, and analysis
Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Susan Cordell (susan.cordell@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: October 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for 10 months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is part time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $1646.67 - $1,820.00 monthly.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Questions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email ORISE.USFS.PSWRS@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.

Qualifications
The qualified candidate should be currently pursuing or have received an associate's or bachelor's degree in the one of the relevant fields. Degree must have been received within the past five years, or anticipated to be received by 5/31/2028.
