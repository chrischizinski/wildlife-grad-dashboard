Description
Mountain ecosystems are among the regions most susceptible to temperature warming, and species adapted to alpine ecosystems are predicted to face local extinctions via physiological and/or behavioral intolerance to rapid increases in temperature. Persistence of alpine avifauna will depend upon the ability of individuals to seek out microhabitats that provide cool refugia while engaging in behaviors that reduce energy expenditure. Identifying such microclimate refugia and understanding how alpine birds use them will help inform management strategies for conserving alpine ecosystems in the face of rapid temperature warming. This funded PhD project focuses on two focal species, Rock Ptarmigan and Rock Partridge, using state-of-the-art GPS tracking technology to quantify fine-scale movement patterns, as well as climate monitoring at study sites and land surface temperature mapping using a thermal drone. The project is located in the Swiss Alps and has completed two field seasons, with fieldwork projected to continue for an additional 1-2 years. 

The successful PhD Candidate will have access to the full study data set, with the opportunity to develop new field and/or analytical components depending upon logistics, expertise and interest. The Candidate must hold a MSc degree in biology or equivalent and ideally will show a strong interest in conservation science, environmental management and spatial analyses. 

Additional preferred (but not required) skills include: field experience studying birds or other vertebrates in montane landscapes, strong quantitative background with ability and interest to rapidly gain new skillsets related to the joint analysis of animal movement, climate, and remote sensing data, and knowledge of French and/or German. 

The project will be co-advised as a collaboration between Prof. Dr. Raphaël Arlettaz at University of Bern Division of Conservation Biology (Switzerland) and Assistant Professor Dr. Ian Ausprey at Texas A&M University Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology (USA). The Candidate will spend the first year at Uni Bern and the second two years at Texas A&M University and must be willing and able to commit to this schedule (exact timing negotiable). The PhD will be defended and granted at Uni Bern. 

Start: January 2026. Duration: 3 years, with possible prolongation. Salary according to SNSF rules. 

Applications must be submitted to ian.ausprey@ag.tamu.edu and should include a motivation letter describing your interests, experience and relevance for this position, a CV (including a list of publications if available), abstract of MSc thesis, and contact information for three professional references (institution, email, and phone number).

The application deadline is September 7th, 2025, with online interviews during the second half of September 2025.

Description
The Moore lab at the University of Colorado Denver is searching for 1 Ph.D. student to study the elevational limits of dragonflies in Colorado (http://moore-evo-eco.weebly.com). This position is fully funded by the National Science Foundation, including 4+ years of support as a graduate research assistant and a tuition waiver. Ideally, the successful applicant would start in Summer 2026.
 The project will test if low oxygen prevents species from dispersing to higher elevations in response to global change (https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2532582). The successful applicant will be responsible for 1) surveying the current elevational limits of dragonflies in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and 2) testing if a species’ tolerance to heat, cold, and low oxygen predicts how far upslope it has moved in the last 20 years. This project will entail both field and lab research.
 The successful applicant will need to hike to and conduct field research at high-elevation wetlands in the Rocky Mountains. Much of the field work for this project will take place in remote and rugged wilderness areas across Colorado. As such, a love of the outdoors and prior backcountry experience is strongly preferred.
 Minimum qualifications include all of the following:
Meeting admissions criteria to CU Denver’s Integrative & Systems Biology PhD program (https://clas.ucdenver.edu/integrative-biology/graduate-programs-department-integrative-biology#admission_requirements-346)
Comfort in remote wilderness areas
 Preferred qualifications include ANY of the following:
MS in Biology, Ecology, Aquatic Ecology, Wildlife Biology, or equivalent
Experience with eco-physiological topics and techniques
Experience with the R statistical environment
Eligibility for in-state tuition through the WICHE program (https://www.wiche.edu/our-region/)
 If you are interested, please email the following materials to Michael Moore (michael.p.moore@ucdenver.edu) by November 1st, 2025: 1) a 1-2 page cover letter detailing your interest in the position and relevant experience/qualifications; 2) your CV; and 3) contact information for at least 2 references. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, and top applicants will be interviewed and encouraged to apply to CU Denver’s Integrative Biology graduate program.

Description

The faculty of the School of the Earth, Ocean and Environment (SEOE) at the University of South Carolina, Columbia campus, invites applications for a 9-month, full time, tenure-track position at the rank of Assistant Professor to begin August 16, 2026.


We seek an outstanding individual to establish a nationally recognized, externally funded research program in fisheries and related areas of biological oceanography. The successful candidate will expand our focus and visibility as an international leader in the study of estuarine and marine processes. This position will complement existing strengths in theoretical and applied marine biology research across the SEOE, the Baruch Marine Field Lab, and the Department of Biological Sciences. We are especially interested in applicants with research interests in fisheries-related areas, which may include (but are not limited to) fisheries ecology; coastal environmental health; population and ecosystem dynamics and modeling; and fisheries management and conservation. Methods employed might include or combine theoretical, observational, experimental, or “big data” approaches. Candidates will be expected to establish an independent, extramurally funded research program in fisheries oceanography. The teaching load will be one course per regular semester (1:1), which may include an undergraduate course for non-science majors, an undergraduate course for SEOE majors, and a graduate-level course in the candidate’s area of research expertise. The successful candidate is expected to contribute to faculty committee service within the SEOE unit. Applicants must have a Ph.D. in fisheries oceanography or a closely related field, at least one year of post-doctoral experience by the start of the appointment, and a commitment to excellence in teaching.


How to Apply


Applicants must apply online via the USCJobs website. Applications must include (1) a cover letter, (2) curriculum vita, (3) a research statement, (4) a teaching statement, and (5) contact information for at least three references. Review of applications will commence on October 1, 2025 and will continue until the position is filled. Inquiries about this position may be directed to search chair Associate Professor David Fuente (email: fuente@seoe.sc.edu ).
