Graduate Opportunities
Description
The Department of Biology at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) is recruiting doctoral students for Fall 2026! All PhD students are guaranteed a full five years of funding, including salary, tuition, and healthcare.
 
 Our department spans a wide range of cutting-edge topics and techniques in biological research, with four major research areas: genomics, microbiology, ecology and evolution, and cellular, molecular and developmental biology. Our PhD program focuses on training students to apply sophisticated quantitative techniques to solve research problems in these areas, giving our graduates a competitive advantage for careers in industry, government, or academia. 
 Applicants can either apply to single labs (direct entry), or apply to enter the rotation program, which gives students the opportunity to conduct research in three labs before deciding which to join. Applications are due on December 1, 2025. Applicants should contact faculty and identify potential advisors before applying – you can begin by consulting the list of recruiting labs below!
 Recruiting professors include:
 Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
JC Buckner: The IDER lab integrates genetics, morphometrics and paleontological data to understand biodiversity dynamics and adaptation in terrestrial tetrapods. Potential graduate students would contribute to our waterfowl research on consequences of introgression for population viability and the genetic basis of convergent phenotypes. Please visit our website, iderlab.org, to learn more.
 Luke Frishkoff: The Frishkoff Lab seeks to understand the evolution and maintenance of biodiversity from local communities to large geographic regions as well as how human impacts are recasting these ecological and evolutionary patterns. We conduct community ecology field research on reptiles and amphibians in Texas, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.
 Alison Ravenscraft: Our ultimate goal is to understand how the bacterial symbionts of insects impact ecosystem-level processes such as plant consumption and pollination. We study both the pairwise bug-Caballeronia symbiosis, and the entire gut microbiome of herbivorous insects (beetles, grasshoppers and caterpillars). We ask whether, when, and how environmentally acquired gut microbiota influence these insects’ responses to stressors such as extreme climates, pesticides, and natural plant defenses.
 Matt Walsh: The Walsh lab evaluates the ecological drivers of evolutionary change in killifish on the island of Trinidad and waterfleas in lakes in Alaska.
 Cellular, Molecular, and Developmental Biology
Loic Fort: The Fort Lab investigates how human stem cells decide their fate on their journey to becoming cardiac cells. We are especially interested in understanding how physical forces influence these decisions. By combining 2D and 3D stem cell models with advanced imaging and molecular tools such as CRISPR, we aim to uncover the fundamental rules of human development and how these processes are disrupted in patients with congenital heart disease.
 Alicia Rogers: The Rogers Lab seeks to understand how small RNA-mediated gene regulation maintains robust execution of cellular and physiological processes during normal and stress conditions. We aim to establish a comprehensive map of the regulatory logic embedded within small RNA pathways that coordinates pathway homeostasis and robust gene expression.
 Anita Quintana: The Quintana lab seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms by which genetic (pathogenic) variants cause birth defects. We have a specific focus on birth defects that disrupt brain and craniofacial development. Our laboratory uses zebrafish as a model system to study development. Zebrafish are an amazing developmental model because they are fertilized outside of their mother allowing for the visualization of development in real time.
 Genomics
Todd Castoe: Population genomics of speciation to link theory with empirical data; Population genomics of schistomiasis transmission and the impact of control measures on natural selection. Genome-wide association studies to link traits with selection in the context of speciation and hybridization. 
 Jeff Demuth: The Demuth Lab studies the evolution of sex chromosomes and molecular genetics of behavior, primarily using beetles as a model system.
 Daniela Palmer: We are interested in understanding the genetic underpinnings of biodiversity, especially in sex-related traits. We study the evolution of sex chromosomes and other parts of the genome that contribute to sex-specific adaptation. Our research focuses on a group of insects known as treehoppers that show fascinating diversity in morphology, behavior, and beyond.

 Microbiology
Qing Tang: Bacterial physiology, pathogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, and host interactions of human pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. We use both cell-culture and mouse models.

Description
Project Description: The Padilla Applied Wildlife Science (PAWS) group at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is in search of a PhD student to work on population ecology and demographic modeling of an invasive ungulate, the aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) in the Chihuahuan Desert. The overarching aims of this effort is to combine field data from non-invasive (camera trap, fecal sampling) and invasive (GPS telemetry, harvest sampling) methods to estimate population size and population vital rates with the goal of parameterizing a demographic population model to inform management. In addition, we are interested in questions related to interspecific interactions (competition, predation, etc), parasitology and disease ecology are also of interest and the grad student will be expected to develop their own research questions within the project. Field work will largely be conducted at a rugged and remote research ranch along the US-Mexico border. 
 About me and the lab: The PI - Benjamin Padilla - is a new Assistant professor at UTEP with experience working in academia and for the state of Oregon’s Department of Fish and Wildlife. The PAWS group aims to use sound field and quantitative approaches to answer applied questions in wildlife ecology, management and conservation through collaboration, communication, and engagement with stakeholders. 
 About UTEP: UTEP is a Carnegie R1 (very high research activity) university with an active research community and a vibrant campus at the U.S.-Mexico border. El Paso offers unique field access to desert and mountain ecosystems, as well as a dynamic cultural environment that is often a pleasant surprise to first-time visitors. 

To Apply: Please send a CV and a brief cover letter describing your background and why you want to pursue a PhD and your interests in the topic. 
 This is an excellent opportunity for someone interested in a career in wildlife ecology and management, particularly for those who want to advance their skills with both statistical analysis and field biology. If you have questions about the university, the lab, or the project, check out the lab website (www.padilla-wildlife.weebly.com), or contact me, Benjamin Padilla (bjpadilla@utep.edu). Also, I will be at TWS in Edmonton in early October, if you are interested you can find me there!

 Description 

Graduate assistantship focused on American black bear-moose interactions – we are seeking a highly motivated person to pursue a PhD degree in the Environmental and Life Sciences Graduate Program at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. The graduate student will join a large team implementing a field research project on the factors limiting and regulating moose populations in Ontario. The student project will be focused broadly on American black bear ecology with a focus on interactions with moose. Specific research questions will be determined collaboratively between the students and research team. The field project is a multi-year program that entails the GPS radio collaring of moose, American black bears, wolves and white-tailed deer to assess cause-specific mortality of moose and examine predator-prey dynamics. The successful applicant will have considerable responsibility and freedom to formulate and address basic and applied research questions grounded in ecological theory. Field work will be highly varied and will include live trapping and deployment of collars on black bears, wolves and white-tailed deer and helicopter capture of adult and calf moose. Further, the project involves deployment of remotely triggered trail cameras, collection of non-invasive samples for black bear population estimation, vegetation surveys, hunter surveys, aerial population surveys and more. The student will be expected to conduct significant field work for their specific project AND assist in all field aspects of the broader project. The student will be co-supervised by Dr. Joe Northrup and Dr. Brent Patterson both of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources & Trent University. 

 

Requirements 

M.Sc. degree in ecology, wildlife biology, or related field is desired, but exceptional past experience may be considered in place of a M.Sc. degree.

 The student will be supported on a Research Assistantship to conduct research to evaluate population abundance and viability for a threatened lagomorph. A focus will be to apply spatially explicit genetic mark-recapture abundance estimation with noninvasive genetic sampling and to develop models that predict density for known New England cottontail metapopulations and conservation focus areas. Additional work will include predictive population viability modeling in a spatially explicit context. The student may pursue additional research questions of their own design, which may center around additional population modeling and/or additional analyses of genetic data to address questions about landscape genetics and conservation genetics concerns. The research and modeling tools developed under this project will be applied to the conservation of New England cottontail populations through a range-wide conservation initiative. The New England Cottontail Conservation Initiative is a large, multi-state collaborative effort that has been focused for a dozen years on restoration of this at-risk species. Graduate students will be immersed in a network, including conservation partners and academic researchers collaborating in this initiative, providing strong outreach and engagement opportunities. Working within this system provides students an opportunity to participate in and help inform adaptive management. 
 The PhD student will be enrolled in the Natural Resources and Earth Systems Science (NRESS) program (https://www.unh.edu/nressphd). The University of New Hampshire is committed to social justice and actively creates an educational environment that fosters diversity, inclusion, and quality engagement for all.
 Qualifications: Successful candidates will have a background in wildlife/ecology/conservation and strong analytical and quantitative skills, as well as experience with or a strong interest in genetic lab work. Interest and ability for field work is also preferred. A Masters degree or relevant experience is preferred, but not required. Willingness to work collaboratively and advance diversity, equity and inclusivity is required. Good communication skills are also desirable. Individuals who are intellectually curious, responsible, eager to learn, team-oriented, and have attention to detail are encouraged to apply. 
 How to apply: Please send a 1) cover letter describing your qualifications, explicitly in relation to the qualifications listed above, including your commitment to fostering a welcoming and inclusive campus climate, 2) a curriculum vitae or resume, 3) unofficial transcripts, and 4) contact information for at least three references to Adrienne Kovach at adrienne.kovach@unh.edu. Use “Cottontail Population Viability PhD” in the subject heading of the email. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, beginning immediately. 
 
Starting Salary: $38,150 for 12 months (with annual increases, each fall)
 Start Date:  January 2026; later start is possible but not preferred – please inquire.

Description
Three MS Graduate Research Assistantships (Fisheries Acoustics; Marine Birds & Mammals; Environmental DNA) at Cal Poly Humboldt: Baseline surveys for assessing potential impacts of offshore wind energy development off northern California

We are recruiting three MS research assistants to take part in an interdisciplinary study intended to support development of baseline information for predicting and assessing potential biological and ecological impacts of proposed floating offshore wind energy infrastructure off northern California. This project is funded by California State University’s Council on Ocean Affairs, Science, and Technology (COAST), and will center on oceanographic surveys of the coastal waters off Humboldt Bay aboard Cal Poly Humboldt’s new research vessel, the R/V North Wind.

One graduate student will be recruited to each of the three subprojects described below, joining a team of faculty researchers and collaborators to collect, curate, and analyze data and to synthesize and report findings through presentations and publications (Collaborative Efforts).  Each will develop a thesis related to the relevant subproject.

Acoustic surveys of fish and krill off northern California (Fisheries Biology, Marin Jarrin and Bjorkstedt Labs; jose.marinjarrin@humboldt.edu).  This subproject focuses on the use of scientific echosounders on the R/V North Wind to survey fish and krill distributions in relation to oceanographic and bathymetric structure, and to assess whether floating objects appear to drive aggregation behavior in fishes.  

Seabird and marine mammal distributions (Wildlife, Barton Lab; daniel.barton@humboldt.edu).   This subproject focuses on the collection of at-sea survey data, compilation with historical local data, and estimation of abundance and seasonal variation in abundance of common seabirds and marine mammals in the California North Coast region, and relating patterns of diversity and abundance to oceanographic and bathymetric structure.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) assessment of coastal fish assemblages (Fisheries Biology, Kinziger Lab; andrew.kinziger@humboldt.edu).  This subproject will implement eDNA metabarcoding approaches to characterize seasonal and spatial patterns of biodiversity in fish assemblages off northern California in relation to oceanographic and bathymetric structure.

Collaborative efforts: oceanographic context and synthesis reports Graduate research assistants will also participate in collection and development of a shared set of oceanographic data based on at-sea observations and remote sensing data products. While it is anticipated that students’ theses will yield stand-alone products and manuscripts, students will also contribute to project-wide synthesis products and presentations.


Appointment and Application Information

Appointment is contingent on admission to and enrollment in the MS program in Natural Resources at Cal Poly Humboldt for Spring 2026 (January start), in either the Fisheries Biology or Wildlife option as appropriate. Participation in project-planning activities is required by early February 2026 to prepare for initial surveys in early spring 2026. Exceptions may be considered.  Students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds are strongly encouraged to apply. 

Graduate research assistants will receive at least $17,000 per year in salary related to research activities and up to $10,000 per year in tuition/fee coverage for two years.  


Minimum qualifications include a bachelor’s degree (B.S. preferred) in a relevant field (e.g., ecology, oceanography, fisheries biology, wildlife biology, marine biology, statistics, or a closely related discipline) or equivalent post-baccalaureate education/experience; eligibility for admission to the Cal Poly Humboldt M.S. in Natural Resources (see the Natural Resources M.S. admissions information: Natural Resources, M.S. Application Information | Cal Poly Humboldt), and demonstrated competencies in (i) quantitative analysis (e.g., R or equivalent), (ii) scientific writing (e.g., reports/manuscripts), and (iii) teamwork and field readiness for small, at-sea operations. 


Preferred qualifications include prior research experience, aligned with the relevant subproject (fisheries acoustics, marine birds & mammals, or environmental DNA), and experience with statistical programming and data analysis (e.g., R), or a demonstrated capacity to learn comparable tools (e.g., Python, MATLAB).

Description
 *Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), located in College Station, Texas.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

The Responsive Agricultural Food Systems Research Unit (RAFSRU) located at Texas A&M University has research training opportunities for highly motivated postdoctoral fellows in prevention of diet-related chronic diseases, plant genetics & biofortification and mechanistic studies in nutrition health associations. https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/college-station-texas-rafsru/responsive-agriculturalfood-systems-research-unit/

The research of the Responsive Agricultural Food Systems Research Unit (RAFSRU) is conducted under the USDA ARS Human Nutrition National Program (NP107).

Description
*Applications may be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A postdoctoral research opportunity is available with the Tropical Crop and Commodity Protection Research Unit within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) located in Hilo, Hawaii.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

The mission of the Tropical Crop and Commodity Protection Research Unit in Hilo, Hawaii is to develop pre and postharvest technologies and management strategies for invasive pests, and to open and maintain market access and improved quality of tropical fruit, vegetable and ornamental crops grown in the Pacific Basin. The long-term goals of our research program are to develop and protect U.S export markets for fresh tropical commodities. An emphasis is placed on expanding and diversifying agriculture and agricultural exports in Hawaii and other states by providing environmentally sound, economically viable systems, treatments, or processes that control quarantine pests, ensure product quality, and increase product value while safeguarding the agriculture of other states.

Research Project: ‘Ulu (breadfruit) has significant cultural importance to Hawaiians and is one of the original staple crops that fed the island nation for close to 1,000 years with high starch, fiber, and protein contents. ‘Ulu also has a low to moderate glycemic index when cooked and can help manage blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Today, at nearly 2,500 miles from the US mainland, Hawaii imports greater than 85% of its food. Disruption to the supply chain can have catastrophic effects as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2020, food insecurity has dramatically increased among the Islands, encouraging the expansion of stable crops and processing capabilities that support the long-term storage and distribution of processed foods derived from these staple foods.

Much of Hawaii ‘ulu supply is sold as fresh produce. Mature ‘ulu, once picked, becomes soft within 1-3 days without refrigeration; the short shelf-life reduces profit margins, generates waste, limits its distribution and export opportunities. The ‘Ulu Cooperative, a collection of small, diversified ‘ulu producers, helped develop processes to produce ‘ulu flour in 2011 to increase its potential market and maximize the yield of ‘ulu. One of the biggest hurdles, however, to the processing of many of Hawaii’s crops is the lack of industrial scale facilities. With Hawaii having the highest electricity retail price at more than double the US average, the cost of large-scale processing is prohibitive. Presently, processing of ‘ulu relies on steamers and dehydrators, which are time consuming and do not produce the most consistent quality of end products. Improved processing methods are urgently needed to overcome the bottleneck of scaling up ‘ulu production, increase market distribution, reduce waste, and foster local economies. Specific activities will include maintaining and operating food processing equipment, experimental design, and nutritional and sensory analysis. Outcomes from this project will be useful to our 'ulu growers as well as other tropical commodities that are extremely perishable and in need of better processing methods.

Learning Objectives: The participant will learn how to incorporate their scientific and technical knowledge in the field of food science with food processing engineering to improve the processing capability for both research within ARS and the stakeholders in Hawaii. The participant will get to explore the possibility of incorporating sensors, spectroscopy, imaging, and machine learning techniques into the postharvest processing workflows and/or pre-harvest evaluation of food quality and safety. The participant will have the opportunity to interact with our commercial and academic collaborators, and present their research to a wide range of audiences in engineering and food science disciplines.

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Peishih Liang (peishih.liang@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full-time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. 

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Description
Institutional Mission:  

The School for Field Studies (SFS) creates transformative study abroad experiences through field-based learning and research. Our educational programs explore the human and ecological dimensions of the complex environmental problems faced by our local partners, contributing to sustainable solutions in the places where we live and work. The SFS community is part of a growing network of individuals and institutions committed to environmental stewardship.

Location:  

Siem Reap, Cambodia     

Start Date:
January 5th, 2026 

Position Summary:  

The SFS Center for Environmental Justice and Mekong Ecologies, located in Siem Reap, Cambodia, seeks an enthusiastic, team-oriented individual to serve as part of a team of faculty and staff that delivers an interdisciplinary, hands-on learning experience to students spending a semester in Cambodia. On a contract basis, the Lecturer in Freshwater Ecology will deliver the 50-hour Freshwater Ecology course during the fall and spring semesters. Additionally, during fall and spring, they will co-teach the 50-hour Directed Research course with other faculty members, leading a faculty-developed directed research project with a small group of students.  

SFS programs are field-based and experiential. This position will engage students in a classroom and through extensive time spent in the field. We encourage faculty to integrate as much fieldwork and hands-on experience into their courses as possible.  

SFS programs do not follow a nine to five model. Faculty are also integral members of the Center’s communal living model, eating and working with the student cohort.   

Faculty are expected to be active members in the community-building process. Additional responsibilities outside of teaching may include participation in community engagement days, involvement in student life, organization of laboratory space, and general Center upkeep. We are especially interested in candidates with experience teaching to a diverse student body, and demonstrated commitment to diversity, inclusion, and cultural competence in a learning environment, conservation, and the Center’s host community.   

Center Focus: 
The SFS Center for Environmental Justice and Mekong Ecologies seeks to understand both the conflicts and synergies of conservation and development. Students gain a sense of the richness of the greater Mekong region—biodiversity, social and cultural diversity, and ecosystem services—while exploring strategies for sustainable livelihoods within Cambodia, a highly productive and diverse country in Southeast Asia.  

The interdisciplinary themes of natural sciences, socio-ecological resilience, environmental ethics and justice, and conservation guide our inquiry. Through coursework, field exercises, and Directed Research, students study people’s dependence on the environment, examine various threats to the environment and to livelihood resilience, and explore the tools and strategies for mitigating the threats and promoting well-being among rural communities. 

Minimum Qualifications:

Ph.D. and university-level teaching experience in freshwater or aquatic ecology, environmental science, conservation biology, or related fields. Candidates with a Master’s degree and significant scholarship may be considered. 

Fluency in English (all courses taught in English) 

Field research experience, preferably in the fields of freshwater ecology, conservation biology, natural resource management, or related fields. 

Strong skills in quantitative research methods 

Extensive knowledge and experience in statistical analysis 

Demonstrated commitment to creating inclusive learning environments 

Demonstrated ability to work as part of an interdisciplinary teaching and research team 

Track record of research publications 

Demonstrated commitment to environmental issues 


Preferred Qualifications: 

Candidates with pre-existing work authorization for Cambodia and/or are a Cambodian national are preferred     

Experience working in SE Asia, particularly Cambodia

Experience teaching field courses 

Experience with residential student group management and/or risk management 

Fluency or proficiency in Khmer 

Experience cross-teaching or collaborating on projects in conservation biology, natural resource management, or interdisciplinary environmental studies with a focus on human–environment interactions 

Able to operate standard transmission vehicles (driving license may be required) 

Track record of grant writing success 

Current First Aid, CPR, and/or Wilderness First Aid certification 

Course Descriptions: 

Freshwater Ecology: This course introduces students to the freshwater ecology of Cambodia’s Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake, one of the world’s most interesting flood-pulse ecosystems. Students investigate key ecological processes such as primary productivity, nutrient cycling, food webs, and species interactions in river–lake systems shaped by seasonal hydrology. Hands-on training includes fish morphology and assemblage identification, water quality sampling, species surveys, and biodiversity indices to assess ecosystem health. To complement ecological fieldwork, students conduct interviews and stakeholder analyses to explore how fishing livelihoods, agricultural expansion, and resource use intersect with water quality and ecosystem dynamics. Through this integrated lens, students develop a deeper understanding of the ecological and human dimensions that sustain and challenge Cambodia’s freshwater systems. 

Directed Research: This course provides students with the opportunity to apply ecological, biological, and/or social-scientific methods to a field research project that addresses a local issue related to the environment. We will also investigate the ways that various methods and theories distinguish (or don’t) fact from interpretation, cause from correlation, and advocacy from objectivity. The directed research topics are derived from the SFS Center’s Research Plan as defined by the Center staff and local stakeholders. Through the Directed Research project, students will contribute to a growing body of scientific research that informs local conservation and resource management decisions. SFS program lecturers lead a small group of students in this research component of the program.
