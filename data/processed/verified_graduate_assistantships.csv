Research Project: The US National Poultry Research Center (USNPRC) is seeking a postdoctoral fellow to investigate the complex molecular interactions between Infectious Laryngotracheitis Virus (ILTV) and the host immune system. As an alphaherpesvirus, ILTV causes significant economic losses worldwide through respiratory distress and decreased production in poultry. This research specifically focuses on the characterization of virus-encoded immunoregulatory proteins, known as virokines, which serve as evolved mechanisms allowing the virus to subvert or evade the host’s innate and adaptive immune responses. By utilizing synthetic biology and reverse genetics, the participant will dissect the function of these proteins to identify targets for attenuation, ultimately leveraging these insights to engineer next-generation vaccine candidates using viral-vector platforms to bridge the gap between fundamental virology and applied veterinary medicine.

Research activities will include the characterization of novel ILTV-encoded virokines to determine their specific cellular targets within the avian immune system and develop novel vaccines. The fellow will determine the role of these immunomodulatory proteins in viral replication and pathogenesis using both in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, the project involves utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 and recombineering to generate mutant viruses lacking specific virokines to assess their potential as live-attenuated vaccine candidates. To ensure rigorous evaluation, the participant will establish standardized immunological assays to define the correlates of protection, focusing on both mucosal and systemic cellular responses. Finally, the project culminates in the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of these candidate vaccines within BSL-2 animal facilities.

Learning Objectives: 

The participant will gain advanced technical expertise in synthetic biology and the genetic manipulation of large DNA viruses.
The fellow will receive hands-on training in cutting-edge vaccine development
The program offers unique experience in conducting high-containment research within BSL-2 laboratory environments.

Description
Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center is seeking 1 student contractor technician for the 2026 summer field season for research on the Dakota skipper, a Federally listed butterfly. Research will focus on questions concerning site occupancy and skipper detectability. The technician will be responsible for surveying for Dakota skippers and performing vegetation surveys in grassland sites in North and/or South Dakota, exact location(s) TBD. The technician will be trained in data-collection methods at the beginning of the field season. Skipper surveys will mostly occur in June and July while vegetation surveys at the same sites will occur in August. Start date is somewhat flexible centered around mid-May, while the end date is also likely flexible (~ end of August).

Field work is extensive and requires long hours walking in prairie sites, in uneven terrain and off trail, sometimes in challenging weather conditions. Field work will involve exposure to a wide variety of weather conditions including cold, mud, intense heat, and humidity. Exposure to biting insects and ticks is possible. At the end of each field day, when out of the field, the technician will likely be expected to do data entry/management tasks. Housing will be provided and is likely to be in campers, and it is possible that technicians will be asked to move housing (camper) locations during the field season. For this reason, trailering experience or experience living in and maintaining campers would be considered a bonus, but is not required for the position.

This position is only open to students or recent graduates (graduated less than 1 year from start date)
(Ex. If graduated in June 2025, you qualify for our start date in mid-May 2026). Interested applicants should submit an updated resume, a recent copy of their academic transcripts, and a copy of diploma if applicable. Selections may be made as resumes come in.

Start Date: mid-May 2026 but somewhat flexible

Location: central North Dakota

Salary: $18.78-21.01 depending on experience and education. Housing included. Generally working 40-50hr/week

Qualifications: Selectees will be hired as Student Service Contractors.
This position is only open to current students or recent graduates (graduated less than 1 year ago from start date), including graduate degrees.

https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/ithaca-ny/robert-w-holley-center-for-agriculture-health/emerging-pests-and-pathogens-research/

Research Project: The Emerging Pests and Pathogens Research Unit (EPPRU) is seeking a motivated Post Doctoral fellow to participate in a multi-disciplinary research program focused on the molecular biology of plant pathogenic bacteria. Projects within this research unit are generally aimed at solving questions related to the biology of plant pathogens and cover a range of applied and fundamental research topics. The research opportunities for this postdoc will be centered around investigating a new source of genetic disease resistance in potatoes. This resistance trait was identified and mapped in Solanum microdontum (Mcd) by its ability to protect tubers from bacterial soft rot disease.  There are three important questions that need to be addressed to prepare the germplasm for use in applied breeding programs:

Does Mcd resistance provide protection from other potato pathogens;
Does Mcd resistance provide protection to stems, leaves, and other tissues;
What genes are responsible for Mcd resistance. 
For additional background about this project see: doi: 10.1094/PHYTO-05-23-0158-R and doi: 10.1007/s12230-021-09859-8.  

Learning Objectives: The postdoc will have the opportunity to learn advanced bacterial molecular genetics, biochemistry, next-generation sequencing methods and functional genomics, fluorescence microscopy, plant pathology, molecular plant-microbe interactions, and other skills related to developing an independent research program. The postdoc will be encouraged to attend professional conferences to present research results, participate in grant writing, and contribute to writing manuscripts. The research will take place in a USDA-ARS lab located in the Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology Section of Cornell University’s School of Integrative Plant Science, providing a dynamic and inspiring environment with a range of programs to support their professional development.

Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Bryan Swingle (bryan.swingle@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $73,000 annually.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.
