Description
The Bernhardt lab in the Department of Biology at Duke University and the Lowman lab in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington (UW) are jointly recruiting a PhD student in aquatic ecology to start in fall 2026. We are keen to identify a self-motivated and creative student who is interested in contributing to our research focused on how aquatic bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, hornworts) support stream ecosystem function (organic matter storage, nutrient cycling) and freshwater biodiversity. The position is fully funded through a combination of grant funding from the National Science Foundation and relevant teaching/research assistantships, including a paid stipend, tuition waiver, and health insurance.
 The graduate student will join a dynamic and highly collaborative team of freshwater scientists studying how changing climate, hydrology, and human activities alter aquatic ecosystem function and connections with the surrounding landscape. The position will involve participating in fieldwork in New Hampshire, processing samples using various analytical procedures, managing research teams, mentoring undergraduate students, maintaining and analyzing data, writing scientific manuscripts, serving as a teaching assistant, and contributing to the broader lab communities. The student will be expected to work closely with collaborators at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies and the U.S. Forest Service at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. Students will have the opportunity to take advantage of a rich array of hydrologic, biogeochemical, and ecological data that have been collected at Hubbard Brook since the 1950s and will be encouraged to develop dissertations that best align with their stated goals and interests. They may also develop collaborations among associated programs (Duke University Program in Ecology, UW’sQuantitative Ecology and Resource Management Program) and research groups (Duke River Center, UW’sFreshwater Initiative).
 Successful candidates will be: enthusiastic about aquatic ecology; organized and detail-oriented with demonstrated experience managing research projects; and collegial and excited to collaborate as part of multi-disciplinary research groups. Applicants must possess a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field (biology, chemistry, earth/environmental science, etc.) by spring 2026 and a minimum of one year of prior research experience (either in academic or professional settings). There is also a possibility for the student to begin work on the project as a field research technician in summer 2026.
 Interested applicants should submit a one-page cover letter (describing past experience, motivation to pursue a graduate degree, and interest in this position), a CV or resume, an unofficial transcript, and contact information for three references via e-mail to both Emily Bernhardt (emily.bernhardt@duke.edu) and Heili Lowman (heili.lowman@duke.edu) by October 15. We are jointly committed to building equitable, supportive research communities and strongly encourage applications from candidates with a diversity of experiences, interests, and identities. Applicants whose skills and interests best align with the research team will be invited to conduct interviews in late October. Competitive applicants will be invited to apply to the location(s) of their choosing. The student may choose to apply/matriculate at either Duke University in Durham, NC or the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. Neither graduate program requires applicants to have taken the GRE. Please reach out to either Emily or Heili with any questions regarding applications, graduate programs, lab groups, or research projects.

Description
I am looking for a new doctoral student in my Aquatic Ecology lab for Fall 2026 (North Miami, FL). I am looking for an independent thinker who is honest, hard-working and motivated to study population or community ecology in aquatic ecosystems, specifically in wetlands. The PhD project may involve use of long-term data collected on federal and state-funded projects.  Dissertation topics are partly at the discretion of the student, but some aspect should involve population ecology, invasive fish ecology crayfish population ecology, or trophic interactions of aquatic animals or wading birds in the context of wetland environmental variation (droughts, floods, nutrients, invasive species).  The immediate context of our work is the Everglades wetlands of southern Florida. 
 The position will be supported each year with a combination of research and teaching assistantship (annual stipend of $30,625 plus a tuition waiver and health benefits) with opportunities to apply for fellowships in later years.   It may be possible that the position could start earlier in the summer (May-June) as a technician before matriculation. 
    Qualifications: 
The positions require a bachelor’s degree in biology plus extensive research experience or a completed MS degree in a related field.  A demonstrated strong work ethic and the ability to conduct field work and data analyses will both be important. The student will become part of a large lab (students, postdocs and technicians) and therefore having the ability to both work in a team and independently will be required. Previous scientific writing experience is important. An MS degree and prior research experience with ecology and/or work in wetlands are desirable.  Minimum academic qualifications include an undergraduate GPA > 3.0 three letters of recommendation. A GRE is helpful, but not required. A valid driver's license is required.  
 Interested students should send their materials to Dr. Nathan Dorn (ndorn@fiu.edu) before officially applying to the PhD program at FIU (https://case.fiu.edu/biology/phd-in-biology/admissions/index.html).  
 Please send a cover letter explaining your research interest, background/suitability and your career goals, and what about my lab is a good fit for your research interest.  Also send a resume or CV (including any degrees/scores) and contact information for 3 professional references (professors, supervisors or employers) before December 4, 2025. Review of applications (by Dr. Dorn) will begin in mid-November. Applicants of minority status and underserved groups are encouraged to apply.

Description
 Overview 
We are seeking a student to undertake doctoral research investigating the role of predator management and environmental variables on braided river bird conservation in Canterbury, Aotearoa | New Zealand.  The project will work with the Ashley Rakahuri Recovery Group, a community conservation organisation that undertakes bird surveys and predator control on the river. We anticipate a project that builds on the strong work of this group to answer questions related to understanding the optimal interventions that community groups can take to increase populations of endemic braided river birds. There is some scope for the student to develop their own research questions within this broader research focus. 
 The student will be be enrolled in Te Kura Pūtaiao Koiora |The School of Biological Sciences at Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury (UC) in Christchurch. Tenure is for three years, and is entirely research-focused, with no required coursework. The scholarship provides a tax-free stipend of $32,650 per year and also covers all tuition fees, for three years. 
 Project Background 
Braided rivers in New Zealand are breeding sites for a range of endemic birds, some of which are declining. The Ashley River/Rakahuri is a smaller braided river which has several rare or declining species (including black fronted tern and wrybill). It is close to Christchurch, and has a community group ARRG (Ashley Rakahuri Recovery Group) which has been doing pest control and nest monitoring since 2004. However, while the trapping effort has increased, bird nest success on the Ashley has declined. 
 The overall aim is to determine the most successful interventions for the conservation of braided river birds in the Ashley River/Rakahuri. 
Research questions that could be addressed by this PhD include: 
What are the key factors determining nest success in selected bird species (including flooding, riverbed island dynamics, weed control, exotic mammalian predators, and native bird predators)?
How effectively can numbers of key pests be reduced (trap types, numbers and locations, use of dogs etc)?
Is the balance of predator species changing and is that affected by pest control?
What is the most effective method for nest monitoring?
How important is reproduction (relative to adult survival) in bird population trends?


The exact focus of the PhD would depend on the skills and interests of the selected student who will work with our supervisory team and ARRG representatives to develop research objectives that best complement the student’s interests, previous experiences, and aspirations.

Who you are

We are looking for a confident, independent, capable, and motivated student with a strong interest in avian conservation. We seek someone curious, enthusiastic, and eager to contribute to innovative research. You should be able to engage productively with external parties - such as community groups - and have strong communication skills. You should have experience working independently in the field, ideally with experience monitoring birds and/or with vertebrate pest control. A good grounding in ecological statistics is highly desirable. Additional skills, such as GIS, mist-netting, nest monitoring, and/or handling of wild birds would be advantageous but are not essential.

These characteristics will be demonstrated by your previous research experience, training, interests and other activities, and underpinned by either a Masters degree or a Bachelors degree with Honours (a 4-year degree with a senior thesis may satisfy this), in ecology or a related field. The ideal candidate will have had some research experience (demonstrated by associated outputs like a publication or thesis). We particularly welcome applications from individuals from under-represented groups.

A valid New Zealand driver’s license and ability to drive safely in New Zealand conditions (a mix of urban and country roads) will be required.

Applicants must meet the eligibility requirements of the University of Canterbury, and must be available to begin study by March 2026.

To apply, please provide:

1. A cover letter that outlines your motivation, interests and experience.

2. A curriculum vitae and copies of your academic transcripts (unofficial copies are fine at this stage).

3. Contact information for two referees able to comment on your academic and other achievements.

Applications should be emailed as a single pdf file with your name in the file name to Sara Kross (sara.kross@canterbury.ac.nz) with “PhD Scholarship on braided river birds” in the subject line. The position is open until filled, but we recommend submitting applications by 15 October for full consideration. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions.

Description
The Hileman Population Ecology and Wildlife Management lab seeks a highly motivated student with an interest in population ecology, wildlife management, and herpetology. Recent work by Clark et al. (2025, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2501745122) found evidence of inbreeding and inbreeding depression in two eastern massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus) rattlesnake populations in southwestern Michigan. The successful applicant will build upon this work and conduct research related to the following objectives: 

1) Estimate the extent of inbreeding at a neighboring disjunct population using the genomic methods of Clark et al. (2025). This information will be used to evaluate if restoring connectivity between these two historically connected populations is warranted and is likely to increase the probability of persistence. 

2) Identify a suitable location for installation of a wildlife underpass to restore connectivity and gene flow between two historically connected eastern massasauga populations using radio telemetry and GIS methods. 

3) Evaluate the efficacy of ongoing habitat restoration using detection/non-detection data in a Before-After-Control-Impact design. 

Start Date: Spring 2026 
 
Qualifications 
The successful application will possess demonstrated excellent written and oral communication skills, be self-motivated, and able to work both independently and as part of a team. Candidates must have a B.S. or B.A. degree from an accredited university and a valid driver’s license by 1 January 2026. Although not a requirement, preference will be given to applicants with a background in spatial ecology, biostatistics, and/or genetics, and familiarity with R programming language and GIS. Previous field experience working in adverse weather conditions, especially with salamanders, is also beneficial. The successful applicant will be expected to produce high quality research, present their work at professional conferences, and publish their findings in peer-reviewed journals.

Description
A Master of Science (MSc) position is available at Auburn University (start date: January 2026). The student will be hosted by the Aquatic Reproductive Physiology lab (P.I. Dr. Ian A.E. Butts) and the Auburn University Shellfish Lab (P.I. Dr. Andrea Tarnecki). In terms of research, our long-term objectives are to address needs identified by the Alabama shellfish aquaculture industry and its stakeholders by testing technology/practices that have the potential to alleviate challenges and bottlenecks encountered by the oyster farming industry. To accomplish this, we take an interdisciplinary approach to test hypotheses in applied aquaculture and hatchery science.

Responsibilities and tasks
To improve oyster production numbers and best allocate available resources, oyster hatchery efforts should prioritize fertilizing eggs with high-quality sperm. Sperm of high quality have increased fertilization, hatch rates, and survival to set. Research on the relationship between sperm parameters and larval success, as well as factors (i.e., genetic, environmental, dietary) that influence sperm quality is lacking for oysters in general, particularly using cryopreserved sperm. To that end, the purpose of this MS project is to identify biomarkers for sperm quality (both fresh and frozen) to improve the efficiency of oyster hatcheries.
 Qualifications
We are looking for a motivated candidate who has:
·  Bachelor’s degree in biology or a similar degree
·  Knowledge of aquaculture and aquatic physiology  
·  Proven ability to carry out goal-oriented work and fluent with data management systems (i.e. Excel, Word, statistical analysis)
·  Lab competences in physiology would be considered an asset - please clarify your experiences in the “motivating letter”
·  Practical husbandry experiences with aquatic organisms will be an asset
·  Good co-operation ability
·  Must have a valid U.S. government issued driver’s license and a satisfactory driving record.

 Approval and Enrollment
This graduate appointment is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in the MSc program within the School of Fisheries, Aquaculture and Aquatic Sciences (SFAAS). For information about our program please see:  http://sfaas.auburn.edu/programs-of-study/graduate-studies/
 Salary and appointment terms
The MSc ($22,500 + benefits for 2 years) salary and appointment terms are consistent with the current rules for graduate students. Typically, a tuition waiver is provided. The students will begin coursework and research in January 2026. This 2 year project will be carried out at the Auburn University Shellfish Lab, which is situated in Dauphin Island, Alabama (https://agriculture.auburn.edu/research/faas/auburn-shellfish-lab/).
 Application
Please submit your application no later than 15 Oct 2026 at 11:59 PM CDT. Applications must be e-mailed to Dr.  Ian Butts (iab0007@auburn.edu) as “one” pdf file containing all materials to be given consideration. The file must include:

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Southwest Research Station (PSWRS) located in Hilo, Hawaii.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: The Hawaii Permanent Plot Network, known as HIPPNET (www.hippnet.hawaii.edu), is a long-term ecosystem and climate monitoring project, conducting vegetation remeasurements every 5 years for monitoring ecosystem plots on Hawaii Island's windward (wet) and leeward (dry) sides. The HIPPNET forest monitoring plots are part of the Smithsonian Institution’s global forest monitoring network known as the Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO, https://forestgeo.si.edu/). The standardized protocols utilized in the HIPPNET project were developed by the Smithsonian’s Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) and are the same as those used by the ForestGEO sites around the world. The HIPPNET plots provide a natural outdoor classroom for hands-on training in these global forest monitoring field techniques utilized in ForestGEO and the computer software and hardware technology currently being used.

The participants will be mentored as part of a larger field team to learn the field protocols for the vegetation measurements within the 2 permanent forest plots of HIPPNET. Field research in the 4 hectare forest plots will involve collecting information for every tree that is greater than 1 cm diameter in size and specifically will involve tree identification, tagging and marking new trees, mapping new trees into the geo-referenced database, collecting tree diameter data, collecting growth habit data, and estimating abundance of herbaceous vegetation. The 2 HIPPNET sites are within different forest types thus providing experience in both tropical wet and dry forests and the opportunity to learn the vegetation communities of these two forest types on Hawaii Island.

Participants will also gain experience in the quality assurance and quality control protocols used by HIPPNET in the field and with the larger dataset. Participants will have the opportunity to learn about how the data is analyzed to answer research questions related to forest dynamics if there is interest by the participant. The fellowship will be primarily field based and out of the USDA Forest Service – Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry office in Hilo, HI.  It will involve hiking steep and rough terrain and standing for long durations. Field conditions can be cold, hot, wet, windy, and/or dry.  

Learning Objectives: The internship will help the successful applicant build knowledge, experience, and competence in the following areas:

Plant identification and vegetation monitoring techniques
Standard ecological sample processing protocols 
Data entry, management, and analysis
Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Susan Cordell (susan.cordell@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: September 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for 10 months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is part time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $400 - $480 per week.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Questions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email ORISE.USFS.PSWRS@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.

Description
The Department of Biology in the College of Science, at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) (http://www.uta.edu/biology/), invites applications for a Tenure-Track faculty position in Bioinformatics at the rank of Assistant or Associate Professor. We seek to expand our strengths in computational and experimental biology to incorporate ground-breaking research in Bioinformatics that leverages modern machine learning and AI approaches.

We invite applications from researchers working at the interface of data science and biology, with particular interest in those leveraging AI and large-scale datasets to investigate fundamental questions in the life sciences. Priority will be given to candidates whose work uses computational and data-driven approaches to explore complex biological systems or processes by integrating across multiple levels of organization, from molecules and gene networks to organisms, populations, and ecosystems. We are also interested in research that integrates diverse data types, such as genomic, phenotypic, environmental, or ecological data, to uncover patterns, mechanisms, and emergent properties underlying biological function, health, disease, and/or ecosystem dynamics. Candidates whose work bridges disciplines and pushes the boundaries of how large-scale data and AI can be used to advance biological understanding are strongly encouraged to apply.

Successful candidates will have a doctoral degree in a relevant field and should demonstrate strong promise for acquiring extramural grant funding and potential for producing high quality research and scholarly or creative achievements that advance the field; and show strong promise to develop and use novel biological, theoretical, and quantitative approaches as well as functional experimental methods to investigate complex biological systems such as the interaction of the environment with an individual’s genome and interactions among organisms.

New faculty will further contribute to the UTA community through high-quality teaching using evidence-based practices to engage undergraduate and graduate (Master's and Ph.D.) students from various backgrounds and experiences effectively.

Start-up funds, salaries, and teaching loads are highly competitive, and successful candidates will have opportunities to apply for generous state funds with which the University and Department has had considerable success. 
 This position is expected to start September 1, 2026.
