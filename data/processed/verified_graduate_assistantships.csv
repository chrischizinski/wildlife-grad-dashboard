Description
PhD Scholarship
Transforming Climate Action – Uncertain Seas 
 
A PhD Scholarship is available at the Centre for Fisheries Ecosystems Research, Fisheries & Marine Institute, Memorial University, St. John’s, NL, Canada.

Transforming Climate Action is a seven year, $397 million collaboration among Dalhousie University, Laval University, University Québec at Rimouski, and Memorial University. The largest research theme within Transforming Climate Action is Reducing Uncertainties in Carbon Cycling in the Northwest Atlantic Seas (Uncertain Seas). The goal of Uncertain Seas is to better constrain the role of the ocean in the Earth’s climate system by reducing uncertainties with physical and biogeochemical processes that control the global ocean carbon cycle. The focus is on the Northwest Atlantic gateway as a major contributor to ocean carbon uptake and sequestration, particularly with respect to the biological carbon pump.
We are seeking a PhD Student to estimate carbon fluxes in the Northwest Atlantic from Earth system and ecosystem models. As a part of Transforming Climate Action, there will be opportunities to participate in workshops with other graduate students from the four institutions. There will also be opportunities for research visits to collaborating labs and conference travel. There may be opportunities to participate in research expeditions, although not a requirement.  

Location: The student will be enrolled in the PhD in Fisheries Science graduate program at the Fisheries & Marine Institute, Memorial University, in St. John’s, NL, Canada.  Memorial University is a hub of ocean sciences located in the Province’s capital. St. John’s is a safe and friendly city with great historical charm, known for its hospitality, live music, a vibrant cultural life, and easy access to wilderness and a wide range of outdoor activities.

Requirements: 
 MSc or equivalent in Fisheries Science, Ecology, Statistics, Mathematics, Marine Ecology, Biology, Oceanography or related discipline 
 Demonstrated quantitative skills in ecosystem and/or statistical modelling
 Strong writing and communication skills

Start date: Flexible, ideally September 1, 2026

Stipend: $30K/year for four years

To apply: Please send a cover letter explaining your relevant experience to, and interest in, the project, CV with academic references (contact information, reference letters not required), and university transcripts to Dr. Tyler Eddy tyler.eddy@mi.mun.ca. If you have an interest in one of the four project areas, please elaborate in your cover letter.

Application deadline: Applications will be reviewed as received. To ensure that your application is given priority consideration, apply by May 31, 2026.

Description
The Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Design at West Virginia University, through Dr. Carol Arantes’s lab, is recruiting a Master’s or PhD student to begin in Fall 2026 to study how changes in river conditions affect aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity. 

The student will be part of a collaborative, interdisciplinary project examining how global hydraulic infrastructure and river management over the past century have altered river discharge regimes and aquatic ecosystems, and how uncertainty in reconstructed historical records affects confidence in global assessments of river change. Working within a multi-institutional research team, the student will collaborate closely with a modeling group to develop and apply new models and indicators of river processes that integrate hydrologic alteration, river fragmentation, sediment transport, river temperature, and patterns of fish diversity and abundance. 

The student will work closely with the PI, postdoctoral researchers, and a multi-institutional team of project partners to integrate ecological data with large-scale environmental and infrastructure datasets. Expected outcomes include peer-reviewed publications, technical reports, and presentations for both scientific and non-scientific audiences. The position offers strong training opportunities in quantitative analysis, interdisciplinary research, and professional development. 

Qualifications 
Applicants must hold a B.S. or M.S. degree in ecology, fisheries, zoology, aquatic sciences, or a closely related field, with a minimum GPA of 3.0/4.0. Successful candidates will demonstrate strong written and oral communication skills, solid analytical abilities, and the capacity to work independently and collaboratively. Experience or strong interest in fish and aquatic ecology is required. Experience with or interest in computer modeling, statistical analysis (Bayesian and/or frequentist approaches), and GIS is highly desirable. 

 Funding:
The selected student will be supported through a combination of Teaching Assistantships (TAships) and Research Assistantships (RAships), for a total of three years of funding.

M.S. students will receive a stipend of $21,000 per year plus a full tuition waiver.

Ph.D. students will receive 9 months of funding per year plus a full tuition waiver, with opportunities for additional summer salary contingent upon successful completion of stream surveys and project fieldwork.

 How to Apply
Interested students should email the following materials as a single PDF directly to:
Dr. Carol Arantes
caroline.arantes@mail.wvu.edu 

Application materials should include: 

A brief cover letter describing research background, interests, career goals, and motivation for pursuing an MS or PhD
A current CV or résumé
Names and contact information for three professional references
Unofficial transcripts and GRE scores (if available)

 Please do not submit materials to the WVU Graduate School at this stage.
