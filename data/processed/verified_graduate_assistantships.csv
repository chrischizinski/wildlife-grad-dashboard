Graduate Opportunities
Description
Indiana State University Department of Biology is seeking graduate applications (PhD preferred) from highly motivated and capable students to study water snake ecology (diamondback, copperbelly, and common water snakes). This position’s research will build off of a current MS water snake project at Indiana State University that is studying distribution, status, and aspects of niche partitioning.
 A position supported by a teaching assistantship (5 of years of support for PhD; $13,500/year + tuition waiver) will be available starting August 2026. Additional summer assistantships may be available.
 There is opportunity for highly motivated and capable students to develop their own projects based on their interests and skills. Other current lab projects include comparing non-invasive monitoring methods, raccoon parasites, and analysis of stress hormones and ecological contaminants in bats and large carnivores. Graduate research projects can combine traditional field ecology studies with techniques and technology such as ecotoxicology, hormone analysis, GIS habitat analysis, mark-recapture, telemetry, and/or genetics/genomics.  Field-based data collection is typically conducted during the summer and laboratory work can be conducted throughout the year.  Fieldwork may involve canoeing/boating, mud, bugs, heat, handling animals, and other strenuous dirty-job type work (generally need to be able to lift ~50lbs).

RIO GRANDE CUTTHROAT TROUT PHD ASSISTANTSHIP

Description & project background: 

The Pregler Lab at New Mexico State University in the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Ecology invites applications for a PhD research assistantship focused on Rio Grande cutthroat trout conservation. The successful applicant will begin in the Fall 2026 semester.

Rio Grande cutthroat trout (RGCT) are the southernmost species of cutthroat trout and have experienced a severe decline in both range and abundance, now occupying only ~12 percent of its historical distribution and requires targeted management interventions to support recovery. Major components of the recovery plan detail the need to secure extant populations and reintroduce individuals within their native range in Colorado and New Mexico. Recent efforts to date include development of a multi-source, genetically diverse broodstock for the Rio Grande basin that is used for reintroduction efforts.

Individuals from this multi-source broodstock were stocked at multiple sites throughout the recently restored Rio Costilla watershed which represents one of the largest native fish restoration projects in the country. While recent research has shown that this composite broodstock is more genetically diverse compared to using single source populations there is a need to evaluate how these fish are performing in the wild. The present project has a number of goals:

          1. Evaluate genetic structure and diversity of reintroduced Rio Costilla RGCT populations
                     a. There is also opportunity to develop questions with demographic monitoring data in this system.
          2. Genetic assessment of Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos basins. 
                     a. Results will help inform multi-source broodstock development for Canadian & Pecos basins and identify additional source populations for Rio Grande basin.
                     b. Results will also provide an updated genetic assessment for RGCT.
          3. There are additional opportunities for the student to develop their own questions using genetic and demographic data.

This project is a collaborative effort funded by the New Mexico Department of Wildlife and there may be potential to collaborate with other university researchers and agencies. Benefits include a salary range of ~$28-29k/year, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance. Funding will also be available for conference travel, workshop training for data analyses, and safety training (e.g., wilderness first aid). The hired candidate will begin in Fall 2026 and will be based at NMSU in Las Cruces, NM.

How to apply: If interested, please compile the following: (1) a statement of interest that describes your educational and research background, as well as your research interests and how this position fits in your career goals (2) curriculum vitae or resume, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts compiled in a single PDF and save as ‘Lastname_RGCT_PhD.pdf’.  Applicants are also asked to upload a writing sample in the application portal. Applications should be submitted through the airtable linked here:  https://airtable.com/app3jNqbQZsYstwx7/pagrpU5GqaI6FnSTg/form 

Applications are due 03/18/26 by 11:59p MT. You can learn more about the Pregler Lab at https://preglerlab.com and any questions about the position can be sent to Dr. Kasey Pregler at kpregler@nmsu.edu.   

Qualifications: 

Required: B.S. in fisheries, biology, or related field and possession of a valid U.S. driver’s license. The successful applicant must also meet the minimum requirements for admission to the NMSU Graduate School (3.0 GPA in last two years of undergrad). Applicants should also have demonstrated excellent written and oral communication skills, and an ability to work independently. 

Preference will be given to applicants with an M.S. degree in fisheries, biology, or related field and have experience working in the backcountry and are willing to lead field work crews in backcountry conditions.

Successful candidates will have proficiency in R, and an interest in genetics and working with large datasets. They should also demonstrate the ability to work as part of a team and have a willingness to lead field work crews in remote backcountry locations. Applicants with experience in fish ecology, statistical & genetic analysis, and hierarchical modeling are encouraged to apply.

Description
I am seeking two motivated master’s students with an interest in crop physiology and environmental stress research. Our research program focuses on understanding how plants perceive and adapt to adverse environmental conditions, with the ultimate goal of protecting crops and mitigating damage caused by environmental stress.

Tomato will be used as the primary research model, as it is both one of the most important vegetable crops worldwide and an excellent model plant for environmental science research. Students will grow tomato plants in our greenhouse, harvest fruits at the mature green stage, and store them under different temperature conditions to investigate the effects of heat stress on fruit ripening.

Project 1: Stable Carbon Isotope Fractionation and Fruit Respiration
One student will focus on developing a novel approach using stable carbon isotope fractionation to monitor the effects of heat stress on fruit respiration pathways, which are closely linked to fruit productivity. Although stable isotope fractionation is widely used in geochemistry, it has rarely been applied to the study of fruit ripening. This approach will provide a multidimensional perspective on how heat stress influences fruit respiratory metabolism. This project includes a collaboration with Rice University, where the student will spend approximately one week each year conducting specialized isotope measurements.

Project 2: Role of Abscisic Acid (ABA) in Heat Stress Tolerance
The second student will investigate the role of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) in tomato plant development and fruit ripening, with a particular focus on its involvement in heat stress responses and resistance mechanisms. This project will compare wild-type tomatoes with mutant lines that have reduced or enhanced ABA accumulation in fruits, with the goal of understanding how ABA influences fruit survival under heat stress conditions.

Through two years of research training, students will gain a strong foundation in the concepts and techniques of environmental stress research, develop proficiency with relevant laboratory and greenhouse instrumentation, and acquire skills essential for careers in environmental science research, agricultural chemistry, and environmental monitoring.

Funding and Qualifications
Prospective students with an interest in agricultural chemistry are encouraged to apply. Students will be supported as teaching assistants, receiving a $15,000 annual stipend and $7,000 in tuition remission, distributed equally across the three academic terms.

Applicants should have a bachelor’s degree in chemistry, biology, agriculture, environmental science, or a related discipline, along with strong written and verbal communication skills and the ability to work both independently and as part of a research team.

Application Process
Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, with the position closing on March 31, 2026. The anticipated start date is September 2026.

Please submit one PDF file containing a cover letter, curriculum vitae, transcripts, and the names and contact information of three references to:

Description
The Integrative Wildlife Conservation lab at Trent University is initiating new research on the movement, feeding, and spatial dynamics of snowshoe hares at Kluane Lake, Yukon, Canada. Hares have been studied for >40 years on-site, and this new work will investigate the role of food and vegetative structure on hare behavioural repertoires in the context of their 10-year population cycles. Hares live on a fine edge between risk of predation/starvation vs. sustainable nutrition, setting the stage for critical behavioural tradeoffs though space and time. Using archived as well as new GPS telemetry and accelerometry data, combined with assays of structural cover and food availability/quality from remote sensing, the project will address some of the following questions: 1) Whether hares adjust movements and feeding behaviours in response to variation in food and cover, and 2) If hare responses are fine-tuned according to cyclic population dynamics and corresponding variation in predation risk and conspecific density. It is uncertain how hares survive on low-quality woody browse and limited shrub cover during winter, setting the stage for using hyperspectral imaging and LiDAR to help develop: 3) Maps of hare nutritional/structural cover landscapes through space and time, and 4) Relating hare behaviours to these complex, variable environments. Additional remote sensing using ground penetrating radar (GPR) can further support these efforts by: 5) Addressing the role of local snow conditions (depth, hardness) on food/cover availability, and corresponding hare responses through the winter season. Data resulting from such research could support dynamic models exploring how hares respond to environmental variation under climate change. The PhD student will have the opportunity to develop specific research questions within the scope of the larger project.

The successful applicant MUST have an MSc in Ecology, Conservation Biology, or related field, demonstrated evidence of peer-reviewed publications, strong field and quantitative skills, and an interest in working collaboratively within a large and diverse research group. Additional desirable skills include animal handling, Remote sensing and post-processing, GPS telemetry, application of animal movement models and spatial analysis, and working in remote field conditions, including during winter.  For additional details, see www.dennismurray.ca.

Description
 The Integrative Wildlife Conservation lab at Trent University is offering a PhD position on the application of remote sensing tools for assessing the state of boreal forest structure and dynamics near Kluane Lake, Yukon, Canada. For decades our team studied vertebrates in the boreal forest ecosystem in the region, and we are now extending this  work to address pressing questions related to vegetation and snow dynamics in this rapidly-changing northern landscape. Using an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with LiDAR, multispectral, and RGB sensors, and combined with archived satellite data for the region, the PhD student may investigate some of the following questions: 1) Patterns of forest productivity, regeneration, and phenology across space and time, and 2) Sources of forest structural heterogeneity and resilience to insect outbreaks or fire. A high priority is to understand how the boreal forest may be impacted by climate change, which can be accomplished by: 3) Combining and back-casting remote sensing products to predict past changes to forest structural cover and deciduous vegetation composition (shrubification). Likewise, we are interested in understanding how variable snow conditions may affect winter forest dynamics and ecology of terrestrial mammals by: 4) Using ground penetrating radar and LiDAR to identify the determinants of local snow conditions (hardness, density). Ultimately, these investigations can lead to: 5) Forecasts of future boreal forest and snow dynamics under IPCC climate change scenarios. The PhD student will have the opportunity to develop specific research questions within the scope of the larger project. 
 The successful applicant MUST have an MSc in Ecology, Geography, Remote Sensing, or a related field, demonstrated evidence of peer-reviewed publications, strong field and quantitative skills, some experience with GIS and related analysis, and an interest in working collaboratively within a large and diverse research group. Additional desirable skills include experience in drone operation, data post-processing, and working in remote field conditions.

Description
A graduate assistantship for a master’s student is expected to be funded at Colorado State University (Fort Collins, CO) working with Dr. Brian D. Gerber (https://bgerber123.github.io/) at the Colorado Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and wildlife researchers at Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The graduate research assistantship will cover university tuition, fees, health coverage, and includes a pre-tax monthly pay of $3000/month. The position is expected to start Fall 2026 and be funded through December 2028.

Study Context: Sex and age class are important demographic parameters used in population modeling, in which the results help guide management decisions and annual harvest quotas of large mammals (e.g., elk, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, mule deer). This work will help develop new methodology and workflows that will aid Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s objective of producing robust empirical demographic data and population estimates for harvested wildlife. 

Focus: The focus of this study will be to collect data on the size distribution of elk sex and age classes (cow, calf, bull) to train and test a predictive approach using AI algorithms (developed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife) to classify animals from high-resolution aerial imagery. Field observations and size measurements (via 3D camera) will be collected to help test the accuracy of AI predictions. An additional avenue of exploration may be data collection and AI classification of sex/age class from camera trap images. The student will be expected to develop a project proposal outlining study objectives in coordination with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and a graduate committee at Colorado State University. The student will focus on technological and software workflows to meet study objectives, however, there will likely be field work opportunities as well (e.g., field observations, drone/aerial surveys). Given the trajectory of the wildlife field, the skills gained in this study will likely be desirable for future employers. 

 Preferred Qualifications: 

-          Ungulate field research experience in the intermountain west
-          Clear interest or experience developing data analysis workflows
-          Clear interest or experience advancing technological innovation (hardware/software) in wildlife science
-          Experience deploying camera traps and managing large data sets
-          Experience with AI algorithms, for example MegaDetector or SpeciesNet
 
Minimum Qualifications:
-          A Bachelor of Science degree in wildlife ecology, biology, natural resource management, or related field
-          A year or more of wildlife related professional research/work experience
-          Strong writing skills
-          Strong work ethic 
-          Desire to collaborate with state wildlife management agencies

To be considered, please send the following materials via email with “AI/Elk Application” as the subject line to Dr. Brian D. Gerber (brian.gerber@colostate.edu) by March 2, 2026: 1) Cover letter outlining career goals, academic interests, and relevant experience related to the minimum and preferred qualifications, 2) resume with contact information for 3-4 personal references, and unofficial copy of B.S. transcripts.

M.S. Opportunity: Riparian restoration tools in working grasslands
The Genomics, Ecology, and Modeling for Conservation Lab at North Dakota State University, led by Travis Seaborn, is recruiting for one M.S. position to join our team working on a recently funded project in collaboration with the Albert K. Ekre Grassland Preserve. For more information on the preserve see: https://ndsufoundation.com/magazine/2021/09/ekre-grassland-preserve. 
 Anticipated start date: Summer 2026. Stiped ~$25,000 for 2-3 years. Tuition waiver also provided.
 The overall project will advance our ability to understand community responses to riparian restoration. Riparian ecosystems in the Northern Great Plains have been heavily altered by anthropogenic activities. Although there are numerous restoration options for riparian ecosystems, a common and effective restoration practice, in particular in incised stream systems, are beaver dam analogs. Using streams at the Ekre Grassland Preserve and nearby public land, we will be looking to do a restoration project using invasive buckthorn woody materials. To achieve this, we are beginning to plan a Before-After-Control-Impact design to assess riparian and floodplain ecosystem responses, including geomorphology, biological community, and water quality. Much of the beaver dam analog research that has been done has occurred in the western United States, and response to these activities in the Northern Great Plains is unknown. Surveys of the biological community may include electrofishing and minnow trapping for fish, camera traps for mammals, visual and auditory surveys for birds, and plant identification along transects.
 The primary goals of this position include:
1.    Identify the impact of beaver dam analogs.
2.    Using geographic information systems, develop beaver species distribution models for the region.
 To apply: Please email travis.seaborn@ndsu.edu a letter of interest, which should include an explanation of fit and past relevant experience, and CV by February 20th.

Description
Project Background: 

We are hiring an MS student to examine whether foraging behavior metrics, like grazing bout duration and velocity while grazing, predict diet quality and average daily weight gain of beef cows on central Arizona rangelands. This region contains a wealth of native biodiversity with ecosystems ranging from mixed desert scrub, pinyon-juniper woodlands, and high-elevation ponderosa pine forest. The student will be co-advised by Drs. Jacob Hennig and Flavie Audoin and will be enrolled in the Ecology, Management, and Restoration of Rangelands program within the School of Natural Resources & the Environment (https://snre.arizona.edu/). Funding is available for 2 years and includes salary, tuition, and health insurance. The student will be based in Tucson, AZ but will conduct field work at the University of Arizona V-V Ranch near Rimrock, AZ. Tasks will consist of attaching GPS ear tags to cattle, conducting field behavioral observations, collecting fecal samples, and analysis of movement data. 

The University of Arizona is the state’s land grant university, located in Tucson, Arizona. The University of Arizona is on the land and territories of many Indigenous peoples; today, Arizona is home to 22 federally recognized tribes, with Tucson being home to the O’odham and the Yaqui.

Required Qualifications: 
·       B.S. in rangeland ecology, animal science, ecology, or a related discipline 
·       A valid US driver’s license 
·       Proficiency in English 

Preferred Qualifications: 
·       Prior experience with livestock handling 
·       Ability to operate 4x4 vehicles 
·       Experience driving and navigating in rugged and remote terrain 
·       Demonstrated written, verbal, and quantitative skills 
·       Field data collection experience 
·       Experience with data management, statistical analysis, and the R programming language 
·       Strong interpersonal skills, with demonstrated ability to work long hours independently and in teams under challenging conditions 
·       Willingness for frequent travel 

To apply, please submit application materials (CV, contact information for 3 professional references, unofficial transcripts, and a cover letter describing interest in the project and career goals) to jhennig@arizona.edu and faudoin@arizona.edu. The GRE is not required for admission or to work with our team, but applicants may also include GRE scores if they think it will improve their packet.

Description
The USGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center is seeking current or recent graduate students (post MS/PhD) for several projects on vegetation dynamics. Researchers may be involved in other projects on sage-grouse and ungulates, depending on skills and interests. 
 Projects focus on 1) mapping sagebrush and yellow sweet clover across the Northwestern Great Plains to support research on sage-grouse; 2) evaluating datasets for fractional cover of vegetation (e.g., RCMAP and RAP), and 3) evaluating vegetation responses to habitat restoration treatments across Montana and Wyoming, particularly for invasive annual grasses in the sagebrush ecosystem. Vegetation mapping involves analyses of imagery from UAVs, traditional aircraft, and satellites to map vegetation at high spatial resolutions across multiple states and years. Research on habitat restoration involves analyses of field survey data and time series of satellite-based data on vegetative cover. Researchers will be expected to 1) manipulate large, spatial datasets in a GIS, 2) analyze data (e.g., mixed models, machine learning algorithms), and 3) prepare manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals. 
 Positions are open to current graduate students or those recently graduated (MS or PhD preferred) that are eligible to work as a student contractor.

Description
 *Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), located in Starkville, Mississippi.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: Aspergillus flavus, a common pathogen of maize globally, is especially problematic in the southeastern region of the United States. It causes ear-rot and contaminates grain with aflatoxin, a highly carcinogenic mycotoxin. Susceptibility to A. flavus infection and aflatoxin accumulation is exacerbated in the presence of biotic and abiotic stresses that commonly occur in corn production environments. Since inheritance of resistance to Aspergillus ear rot is controlled by many QTL across the genome, innovative research will be required to develop and deploy commercially valuable hybrids possessing stable resistance. The fellow will be involved in a research project to

Screen and characterize maize germplasm from different sources to identify germplasm with resistance to Aspergillus flavus kernel infection and subsequent aflatoxin accumulation;
Incorporate resistance to A. flavus into agronomically acceptable maize inbred lines with improved combining ability for yield, and alignment with industry heterotic patterns; and
Discover maize inbred lines that are resilient to extreme weather events and more productive under sustainable management systems.
Learning Objectives: The participant will gain skills in laboratory methodologies, experimental design, maize breeding, and data analysis. Through the course of the project, the participant will gain knowledge of current issues and latest research at the intersection of maize pathology and breeding with a focus on Aspergillus ear rot disease through exposure to the lab's researchers, as well as academic and industry collaborators.

Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Ebrahiem Babiker (ebrahiem.babiker@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: April 6, 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $6,223.16 - $7,459.00 monthly.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Questions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process, please email ORISE.ARS.Southeast@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.

Qualifications
The qualified candidate should be currently pursuing or have received a doctoral degree in the one of the relevant fields (plant pathology, plant breeding, or related discipline). 

Preferred skills:

Experience in conducting lab, greenhouse, and field research in the areas of plant pathology and plant breeding and genetics.
Experience in the screening of germplasm for resistance to biotic stresses and development of disease resistant germplasm
Experience using statistical software such as SAS or R.
Experience in preparation of manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

Research Project: The US National Poultry Research Center (USNPRC) is seeking a postdoctoral fellow to investigate the complex molecular interactions between Infectious Laryngotracheitis Virus (ILTV) and the host immune system. As an alphaherpesvirus, ILTV causes significant economic losses worldwide through respiratory distress and decreased production in poultry. This research specifically focuses on the characterization of virus-encoded immunoregulatory proteins, known as virokines, which serve as evolved mechanisms allowing the virus to subvert or evade the host’s innate and adaptive immune responses. By utilizing synthetic biology and reverse genetics, the participant will dissect the function of these proteins to identify targets for attenuation, ultimately leveraging these insights to engineer next-generation vaccine candidates using viral-vector platforms to bridge the gap between fundamental virology and applied veterinary medicine.

Research activities will include the characterization of novel ILTV-encoded virokines to determine their specific cellular targets within the avian immune system and develop novel vaccines. The fellow will determine the role of these immunomodulatory proteins in viral replication and pathogenesis using both in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, the project involves utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 and recombineering to generate mutant viruses lacking specific virokines to assess their potential as live-attenuated vaccine candidates. To ensure rigorous evaluation, the participant will establish standardized immunological assays to define the correlates of protection, focusing on both mucosal and systemic cellular responses. Finally, the project culminates in the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of these candidate vaccines within BSL-2 animal facilities.

Description
 *Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), located in Ames, Iowa.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: Many crop species have relatives that have also been domesticated, with selection independently being applied in the various species to modify traits such as seed size, dormancy, reduction of seed dispersal, changes in taste or toxic compounds, or changes in photoperiod sensitivity or plant architecture. Within the legume family, more than two dozen species have been domesticated, including plants such as pea, soybean, peanut, and common bean. The many related but independently domesticated species offer an opportunity to determine in which cases the domestications have occurred through modification of genetically corresponding (orthologous) genes, or via distinct, non-corresponding loci. This project will use a combination of analyses utilizing gene families, synteny relationships, genetic association results, and published gene functional information, to catalog and evaluate the genes involved in domestication in crops within the legume plant family. This research has applied value, through identification of genes that are likely to modify important domestication-related traits across many species. The research also addresses basic questions, such as whether domestication has preferentially operated on genes that have unusually high amounts of standing variation within wild populations.

Under the guidance of a mentor, this opportunity will involve: developing and applying methods in computational biology and artificial intelligence to gather information about gene function in the legume family; using the results to identify gene correspondences at several taxonomic levels – in particular, across genera, typically spanning several species of agronomic importance such as beans or chickpeas and also across the plant family as a whole; and to identify correspondences among agronomically important genes across many crop and model species in this large plant family. After identifying corresponding genes, genomic regions will be evaluated for features such as signatures of selection or diversifying or purifying selection, around genes and regions of agricultural importance.

Learning Objectives: The participant will learn and apply methods in computational biology, genetics, and artificial intelligence, including statistical methods of marker-trait association, methods for determining syntenic relationships and for calculating and representing pan-genome relationships, methods for inferring gene families, and methods for inferring evolutionary events from large collections of gene families. The participant will also have the opportunity to read, evaluate, and participate in writing scientific manuscripts in these areas of focus.

Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Steven Cannon (Steven.Cannon@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: March 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $5,185 - $6,273 monthly.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.

 *Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), located in Poplarville, Mississippi.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table.

The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: Stressors that negatively affect honey bee health (e.g., agrichemicals, intracellular pathogens) are common in the beekeeping industry. These stressors act on cellular and molecular processes, but unlike in human and veterinary medicine, cell culture systems are largely underutilized in honey bee and other bee research to study the effects of stressors at a high level of resolution under controlled conditions. Although a continuous honey bee cell line exists, it is persistently infected with a honey bee virus. As an ORISE Postdoctoral Research Fellow, you will collaborate with a team of colleagues led by your mentor to establish virus-free primary cultures using tissues from bee pollinators of commercial importance, as well as from the mite, Varroa destructor, a widespread, often abundant parasite known to transmit honey bee viruses. Reproducible establishment of primary bee and mite parasite cultures will provide a powerful platform for cell-based studies examining host-pathogen and bee-agrichemical interactions and promote creation of innovations that mitigate negative outcomes from these relationships.

Description
 *Applications may be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A postdoctoral research opportunity is available with the Tropical Crop and Commodity Protection Research Unit within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) located in Hilo, Hawaii.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

The mission of the Tropical Crop and Commodity Protection Research Unit in Hilo, Hawaii is to develop pre and postharvest technologies and management strategies for invasive pests, and to open and maintain market access and improved quality of tropical fruit, vegetable and ornamental crops grown in the Pacific Basin. The long-term goals of our research program are to develop and protect U.S export markets for fresh tropical commodities. An emphasis is placed on expanding and diversifying agriculture and agricultural exports in Hawaii and other states by providing environmentally sound, economically viable systems, treatments, or processes that control quarantine pests, ensure product quality, and increase product value while safeguarding the agriculture of other states.

Research Project: ‘Ulu (breadfruit) has significant cultural importance to Hawaiians and is one of the original staple crops that fed the island nation for close to 1,000 years with high starch, fiber, and protein contents. ‘Ulu also has a low to moderate glycemic index when cooked and can help manage blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Today, at nearly 2,500 miles from the US mainland, Hawaii imports greater than 85% of its food. Disruption to the supply chain can have catastrophic effects as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2020, food insecurity has dramatically increased among the Islands, encouraging the expansion of stable crops and processing capabilities that support the long-term storage and distribution of processed foods derived from these staple foods.

Much of Hawaii ‘ulu supply is sold as fresh produce. Mature ‘ulu, once picked, becomes soft within 1-3 days without refrigeration; the short shelf-life reduces profit margins, generates waste, limits its distribution and export opportunities. The ‘Ulu Cooperative, a collection of small, diversified ‘ulu producers, helped develop processes to produce ‘ulu flour in 2011 to increase its potential market and maximize the yield of ‘ulu. One of the biggest hurdles, however, to the processing of many of Hawaii’s crops is the lack of industrial scale facilities. With Hawaii having the highest electricity retail price at more than double the US average, the cost of large-scale processing is prohibitive. Presently, processing of ‘ulu relies on steamers and dehydrators, which are time consuming and do not produce the most consistent quality of end products. Improved processing methods are urgently needed to overcome the bottleneck of scaling up ‘ulu production, increase market distribution, reduce waste, and foster local economies. Specific activities will include maintaining and operating food processing equipment, experimental design, and nutritional and sensory analysis. Outcomes from this project will be useful to our 'ulu growers as well as other tropical commodities that are extremely perishable and in need of better processing methods.

Learning Objectives: The participant will learn how to incorporate their scientific and technical knowledge in the field of food science with food processing engineering to improve the processing capability for both research within ARS and the stakeholders in Hawaii. The participant will get to explore the possibility of incorporating sensors, spectroscopy, imaging, and machine learning techniques into the postharvest processing workflows and/or pre-harvest evaluation of food quality and safety. The participant will have the opportunity to interact with our commercial and academic collaborators, and present their research to a wide range of audiences in engineering and food science disciplines.

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Peishih Liang (peishih.liang@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: 2026.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full-time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience.

 *Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), located in Raleigh, North Carolina.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: A key objective of the Circular Economy for Reimagining Maize Agriculture (CERCA) project supported by USDA-ARS is to develop corn varieties with reduced grain protein content coupled with high yield. This will help US farmers continue to produce corn grain efficiently for animal feed and industrial uses while reducing input costs associated with nitrogen fertilizer. Rather than extracting nitrogen from soil in the form of grain, a new approach to corn agriculture is to recycle nitrogen on-farm as much as possible to improve its profitability and sustainability. One strategy to achieve this goal is to reduce fertilizer inputs and select for new varieties that primarily remobilize nitrogen from senescing leaves to roots, stalks, or cobs rather than seeds.

The participant will help evaluate three generations of selection for reduced grain protein content that were performed independently at three locations (IA, MN, and MO) and in three populations by CERCA collaborators. In 2026 samples of the three starting populations, the most recent selected generations from each location, and control unselected generations will be planted in NC and in other CERCA cooperator locations. The participant will be involved in field experiments and controlled pollinations to produce research materials. The participant will measure grain protein content on 96 individual plants within each sub-population using near-infrared reflectance spectrophotometry. Grain protein content data of each population will be compared to measure the effectiveness of individual plant selection to reduce grain protein content.

The participant will also perform low coverage sequencing of each plant and manage bioinformatics pipelines for genomic data analysis.  Protein content data will be combined with genotype data to permit two tests of functional importance of each genetic variant: genome-wide association study and signals of selection due to allele frequency shifts under selection. Candidate genes identified by these approaches will be evaluated for involvement in biosynthesis and cellular localization of storage proteins. Genes identified in this way will represent targets for future gene editing to improve the rate of genetic improvement for reduced grain protein content. 

Learning Objectives: The candidate will learn about genetic analysis of complex phenotypes in crops and the use of genetics to understand and manipulate grain protein content. The candidate will collaborate with the USDA ARS CERCA team. The candidate will gain experience by participating in CERCA meetings as well as ARS unit meetings.

Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is James Holland (jim.holland@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: July 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $73,944 - $82,357 annually.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: This appointment is part of the Methods and Applications of Food Composition Laboratory effort improve the speed, accuracy, and/or sensitivity of methods for measuring nutrients in the foods Americans eat. Dietary fiber (DF) is the polymeric carbohydrate portion of plant-based foods not hydrolyzed by human digestive enzymes.  DF consumption has been linked to reduced plasma cholesterol concentration, improved glucose regulation, and decreased incidence of heart disease and colorectal cancer. Since 2005 the Dietary Guidelines for Americans have listed underconsumption of DF as a public health concern, however changes the definition of DF have resulted in a complicated and costly process for measuring DF content in foods. The goal of this project is to reduce the cost of dietary fiber analysis. The development of a simplified method for DF determination and adoption by professional organizations such as the AOAC or Cereals & Grains (formerly AACC) would benefit

The fellow will learn how to generate an instrumental method for soluble dietary fiber analysis, along with exemplar data sufficient to initiate an interlaboratory study, which is required for AOAC and AACC approval.  Samples of beans (Great Northern and black), cereal grains (whole wheat and rice), ancient grains (sorghum and spelt), pseudocereals (amaranth and buckwheat), and traditional foods with novel carbohydrate components such as algae (nori and kombu) will be commercially obtained.  Lyophilized, ground, food samples will be digested and under the biomimetic conditions of AOAC 2022.01 in tared digestion tubes, however after digestion, IDF will be isolated by centrifugation.  Bypassing precipitation, proteinaceous and mineral components will be removed from the supernatant using ion exchange resins. The supernatant will be lyophilized and reconstituted at several levels of dilution to optimize method selectivity and sensitivity. Each level will receive the internal standard, diethyleneglycol, and be analyzed by size exclusion chromatography followed by RI detection and universal mass calibration will be performed by viscometry.    As a universal detector, RI allows for absolute quantitation of soluble dietary fiber with no need for ash or nitrogen correction, saving time and reducing cost. Universal mass calibration will offer true molecular weight data for soluble fiber composition.  These data will be published in an AOAC or AACC journal, and a potential interlaboratory study.

Learning Objectives: As a result of this training, the participant will gain knowledge and experience in:

Enzymatic, chromatographic and related methods for the analysis of dietary fiber and other carbohydrates.
Analytical method validation, including assessment of analytical figures of merit, robustness, and method detection limits.
Statistical methods used to evaluate assay variability in nutrition science.
Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Michael Bukowski (michael.bukowski@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Description
ROJECT TITLE: Pinyon Jay response to juniper management, Deschutes County, Oregon.

BACKGROUND: Pinyon Jays (PIJA, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) have experienced significant, range-wide declines over the past 50 years, and are currently under Status Review for ESA listing. Deschutes County, Oregon represents the northwestern-most extent of the species range and lies far outside the extant range of pinyon pine species. Extensive treatments of juniper woodlands have been expedited throughout western states for restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, sage grouse habitat, and altered fire regimes. However, we lack clear understanding of how these treatments impact PIJA populations.  

Management priorities for PIJA in Oregon include assessing impacts of juniper treatments on PIJA and determining state-wide distribution. The primary goals of this project are to experimentally study how juniper treatments impact occupancy, habitat use, and nesting of PIJA on BLM lands in Deschutes County, Oregon. We are implementing a before-after-control-impact study and use bioacoustics monitoring, point counts, and nest searching methods. The MS project will focus on at least one component of the project. This work is in partnership with the East Cascades Bird Alliance, US Fish and Wildlife, and Deschutes BLM. We also contribute to the PIJA Western Working Group and the PIJA Conservation Action Strategy (CAS). The MS candidate will be expected to coordinate with and contribute findings to larger range-wide intiatives. 

LOCATION & PROGRAM: This position supports a student in the Masters of Science in Natural Resources at Oregon Tech in Klamath Falls, OR. Our MS program started in 2024 and is in the Natural Sciences Department, which also encompasses the MS of Medical Science program, and BS programs in Environmental Science and Biology-Health Science. Program description and requirements are here https://www.oit.edu/academics/degrees/natural-resources 

SUPPORT: This position includes the opportunity for a Graduate Teaching Assistantship for the Academic Years 2026-2026 and 2027-2028. The GTA will teach labs in the 200-level Principles of Biology series for majors, &/or similar courses within the students expertise. GTAs cover two 3-hour sections per term. Oregon Tech is on a quarter system. Fall, Winter, and Spring terms are 11 weeks. Our academic year runs from mid-September to Mid-June.  The GTA provides a per-term stipend and partial tuition remission during the academic year (Fall through Spring terms). In addition, this research assistantship will provide additional part-time stipend during the spring term, and full-time hourly salary over the summer. Some travel costs from Klamath Falls to Bend, OR will be covered. The graduate student will be expected to use their own vehicle, preferably one that can handle rugged, rocky roads to access field sites. If the student would prefer to forgo the GTA position and cover their own academic costs, that would be an option. 

POSITION REQUIREMENTS: The candidate should have a Bachelors degree in Natural Resources, Wildlife, Ecology, Environmental Science or a closely related program of study and should meet the requirements for acceptance into the Masters of Natural Resources program at Oregon Tech. Ideally, the applicant will have at least 2 years of field experience studying birds, particularly nest searching and point counts. Experience with bioacoustics monitoring (ARUs, BirdNET) will be especially helpful. Additionally, experience doing habitat analyses (Occupancy modeling, RSFs, SDMs) using program R and GIS will be very valuable.  The candidate should have proven ability to work independently in remote areas, and as a member of a team, including supervising undergraduates and working with volunteers. 

 

DATES: Start date is flexible. We are beginning the greater project design and implementation this winter 2026, therefore, the candidate could start as early as March, 2026 as a temporary hire. The academic year begins in mid-September, 2026. 

LOCATION: Oregon Tech is in Klamath Falls, OR, a small rural region of south-central Oregon. The field research about 3 hours north, near Bend and Sisters, Oregon in the east Cascades, sage-steppe biome. This region is famous for its scenic beauty, biodiversity, and outdoor recreation including hiking and trail running, mountain biking, skiing, and water sports.  

APPLICATIONS: Please email a cover letter detailing your experience, interest in the project, and career goals, along with your CV to Jherime.kellermann@oit.edu ASAP.  We will review packages as they are received.

Description
 Title: Graduate Research Assistant – M.Sc. in Forest Recourses, emphasis in Wildlife Management 
Affiliation: Snowden Waterfowl Center of Excellence, University of Arkansas at Monticello 
Location: Monticello, Arkansas 
Start date: May or August 2026 
Available funding – up to 3 years 
 Position Description: The Snowden Waterfowl Center of Excellence within the College of forestry, Agriculture, and Natural Resources at the University of Arkansas at Monticello is recruiting applicants for the position of Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) to pursue a Master’s of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Forest Resources studying the spatial arrangement of habitat components including bottomland hardwood reforestation on habitat suitability for midcontinent mallards. Specific aspects of the study will include the construction of a user-friendly, ArcGIS online decision support tool for prioritizing areas for reforestation that will maximize co-benefits for waterfowl. The position carries an annual stipend of $20,000 plus tuition waiver. Expected start date of May or August 2026. 
 Project Description: Bottomland hardwood forests are under extreme and accelerated pressure from anthropogenic and environmental stressors, subsequently impact many ecological processes including the degradation of habitat quality for forested wetland dependent waterfowl. The extent of historical loss from drainage and agricultural conversion; degradation of forest health from insects and disease; shifts in tree species composition from water stress, and excessive declines in abundance of wintering waterfowl in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley are overwhelmingly documented. Thus, restoration and reforestation effects are of utmost priority in the region and newly emerging carbon credit markets may provide the catalyst needed to accelerate reforestation in the region to improve habitat suitability for wintering mallards. The purpose of this project is to provide guidance for carbon-based reforestation efforts to maximize the co-benefits for waterfowl.   
 Requirements: Applicants must have a 2.7 overall undergraduate GPA or 3.0 GPA in the last 60 semester hours of undergraduate courses. Also required a B.S. degree in geospatial sciences, geography, wildlife management/conservation, or related field, while experiences with waterfowl, GIS, remote sensing, data science, and landscape ecology are preferred. Applicants must have a valid U.S. driver’s license or obtain the same within 60 days of starting employment. Overnight travel and fall/winter field work are required as well as the ability to work outdoors in all weather conditions. 
 Location and Facilities: The Snowden Waterfowl Center of Excellence is housed within the College of Forestry, Agriculture & Natural Resources at the University of Arkansas at Monticello, in southeastern Arkansas. Graduate students will have a designated office space and computer, and will work alongside faculty, staff, and other graduate students within the Snowden Waterfowl Center and College of Forestry, Agriculture & Natural Resources. 
 Application & Additional Information: Please send cover letter, CV or resume, and list of professional references to Dr. Douglas Osborne by email at osborne@uamont.edu. Specify ""BLH Mallard Assistantship"" in the subject line of the email.

Description
Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center is seeking 1 student contractor technician for the 2026 summer field season for research on the Dakota skipper, a Federally listed butterfly. Research will focus on questions concerning site occupancy and skipper detectability. The technician will be responsible for surveying for Dakota skippers and performing vegetation surveys in grassland sites in North and/or South Dakota, exact location(s) TBD. The technician will be trained in data-collection methods at the beginning of the field season. Skipper surveys will mostly occur in June and July while vegetation surveys at the same sites will occur in August. Start date is somewhat flexible centered around mid-May, while the end date is also likely flexible (~ end of August).

Field work is extensive and requires long hours walking in prairie sites, in uneven terrain and off trail, sometimes in challenging weather conditions. Field work will involve exposure to a wide variety of weather conditions including cold, mud, intense heat, and humidity. Exposure to biting insects and ticks is possible. At the end of each field day, when out of the field, the technician will likely be expected to do data entry/management tasks. Housing will be provided and is likely to be in campers, and it is possible that technicians will be asked to move housing (camper) locations during the field season. For this reason, trailering experience or experience living in and maintaining campers would be considered a bonus, but is not required for the position.

This position is only open to students or recent graduates (graduated less than 1 year from start date)
(Ex. If graduated in June 2025, you qualify for our start date in mid-May 2026). Interested applicants should submit an updated resume, a recent copy of their academic transcripts, and a copy of diploma if applicable. Selections may be made as resumes come in.

Start Date: mid-May 2026 but somewhat flexible

Location: central North Dakota

Salary: $18.78-21.01 depending on experience and education. Housing included. Generally working 40-50hr/week

Qualifications: Selectees will be hired as Student Service Contractors.
This position is only open to current students or recent graduates (graduated less than 1 year ago from start date), including graduate degrees.
Current students (not yet graduated) must be in good academic standing and enrolled in a degree program at a recognized educational institution.
Applicants should have a B.S. or B.A. degree in wildlife, natural resources, or in a related field or will have a B.S. or B.A. by the time of their start date for the position. Applicants with 2+ years of college experience are also encouraged to apply.
Must be able to follow an established survey protocol and accurately record data. Applicants must be in good physical condition and be able to work long hours in variable weather conditions with little supervision. Technicians may be required to lift objects weighing up to 40 pounds in the performance of assigned duties. Attention to detail and the ability to focus on minute differences in butterfly appearance/identification and behavior is required. Experience using DSLR cameras is a bonus. Applicants with a working knowledge of pollinators (especially butterflies) and butterfly identification are especially encouraged to apply, but previous pollinator experience is not required. Birding experience is not required, but birding skillsets often translate well to work with pollinators/butterflies.
You will be required to operate a government-owned vehicle in the performance of your official duties. Applicants for this position must meet the following requirements: (1) possession of a valid State driver’s license, and (2) documentation of a safe driving record. If selected, you will be required to provide proof of a valid State driver's license and a copy of your driving record.

Start Date: May or September 2026                                           Location: Prince George, BC

Project Overview

This collaborative project with the British Columbia Ministry of Forests examines how interacting disturbances and climate change are reshaping forest trajectories in northern British Columbia. Focusing on landscapes affected by windthrow, insect outbreaks, and wildfire, the research aims to understand how disturbance severity and legacy effects influence long-term forest resilience.

The MSc student will investigate how disturbance legacies shape regeneration, stand structure, tree growth, and carbon dynamics using a combination of field-based forest surveys, dendrochronology (tree growth analysis), and geospatial tools, including drone-based lidar and satellite remote sensing. The project integrates ecological theory with applied management questions, providing hands-on experience in field ecology, quantitative analysis, and multi-scale disturbance assessment.

Qualifications

·        BSc (or expected completion) in forestry, ecology, environmental science, geography, or related field

·        Interest in forest disturbance ecology and climate change

·        Experience with fieldwork in forest ecosystems

·        Strong quantitative skills (R preferred)

·        Experience with GIS or remote sensing is an asset

·       Willingness to work in remote field conditions

Funding

Funding is anticipated at $20,000 for two years, subject to final confirmation. The student will also be encouraged to apply for scholarships (e.g., NSERC CGS-M, UNBC internal scholarships) and teaching assistantships.

Why UNBC?

UNBC is located in Prince George, the hub of northern British Columbia, offering direct access to diverse forest ecosystems shaped by multiple disturbance regimes. The university is recognized for its strengths in natural resources, forestry, and environmental science.

Description
Position Description: 
Our research team is dedicated to studying major international quarantine pests and invasive forest species, achieving several innovative breakthroughs. We are recruiting one M.S. student/one Ph.D. student with interests in biological invasions and quarantine, biodiversity conservation, and forest pest monitoring to join us.
In our research on the spongy moth, we have used molecular markers and morphological studies to confirm, for the first time, the invasion of the European spongy moth in China. We also established a tracing system for spongy moths, advancing international pest tracking and tracing technologies. In the field of forestry invasive species, we identified the pine wood nematode’s northward spread across the Yangtze River, studied the distribution and spread of multiple invasive species, developed molecular diagnostic tools, proposed monitoring, and control strategies for European woodwasp, and effectively reduced infestation rates. In pest risk analysis, we were the first in China to build a quantitative pest risk analysis system supported by @risk software. We utilized climate models to predict potential suitable habitats for invasive species, thereby strengthening biosecurity management.
If you are eager to contribute meaningfully to national and international forest biosecurity, we welcome your application. The candidates may have the opportunity to develop additional research questions that align with the research goals, and the students will be supervised by Prof. Juan Shi.

Description
Position Description: 
Our research team is dedicated to studying major international quarantine pests and invasive forest species, achieving several innovative breakthroughs. We are recruiting one M.S. student/one Ph.D. student with interests in biological invasions and quarantine, biodiversity conservation, and forest pest monitoring to join us.
In our research on the spongy moth, we have used molecular markers and morphological studies to confirm, for the first time, the invasion of the European spongy moth in China. We also established a tracing system for spongy moths, advancing international pest tracking and tracing technologies. In the field of forestry invasive species, we identified the pine wood nematode’s northward spread across the Yangtze River, studied the distribution and spread of multiple invasive species, developed molecular diagnostic tools, proposed monitoring, and control strategies for European woodwasp, and effectively reduced infestation rates. In pest risk analysis, we were the first in China to build a quantitative pest risk analysis system supported by @risk software. We utilized climate models to predict potential suitable habitats for invasive species, thereby strengthening biosecurity management.
If you are eager to contribute meaningfully to national and international forest biosecurity, we welcome your application. The candidates may have the opportunity to develop additional research questions that align with the research goals, and the students will be supervised by Prof. Juan Shi.

Description
Title: Evaluating models to estimate Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) state and infection stage from antemortem tissues samples 

Description: 
The research associate/postdoc will work as part of an interdisciplinary team on a USDA–APHIS-funded project, that aims to (1) evaluate the limitations and potential inaccuracies of existing occupancy models that estimate CWD population prevalence and individual infection stage using multiple antemortem tissue samples and lab tests and (2) develop new approaches via sampling design, subsequent laboratory detection methods, and data analysis to reduce or eliminate inaccuracies, while accounting for expected tissue- and test-specific differences in sensitivity and specificity that likely vary among cervid species.

 We seek a research associate/postdoc with good quantitative skills, a background in disease ecology (preferably CWD or related diseases), and an ability to communicate and collaborate well with a diversity of partners. The research associate/postdoc will review information on existing methods to estimate CWD disease state and infection stage and use simulation to determine potential inaccuracies of these methods with likely dependencies among tissues and imperfect sensitivity and specificity of various lab tests. The research associate/postdoc will develop new approaches via sampling design, subsequent laboratory detection methods, and data analysis to reduce or eliminate inaccuracies, while accounting for expected tissue- and test-specific differences in sensitivity and specificity that likely vary among cervid species. Using this information, they will evaluate sampling design trade-offs and determine optimal sampling and testing strategies to meet common objectives for CWD studies of wild cervid populations, and potentially captive populations.
 
 The research associate/postdoc will have opportunities to work locally with collaborators at USDA National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) and collaborating state agencies (e.g., Nebraska Game and Parks). The research associate/postdoc will work closely with this team of quantitative ecologists and disease ecologists to develop Bayesian approaches to estimate conditional probabilities of disease state and infection status using multiple tissue types and laboratory assays with false positive and false-negative errors. Findings from this work will inform future study design, data collection, and use of laboratory test results for various scientific and management objectives.
 Minimum Qualifications:
Applicants must have a Masters, PhD, or equivalent degree in Quantitative Ecology/Biology, Disease Ecology/ Epidemiology, Statistics, or closely related field at time of hire.
2+ years of experience post-masters employment working with various state or federal agencies using simulation and subsequent statistical models (e.g., occupancy models) to evaluate model performance.
Demonstrated experience publishing scientific papers in one or more of the above fields.
Must be legally authorized to work in the United States by position start date. CSU will not provide a visa.
 Preferred Qualifications:
PhD, or equivalent degree in Quantitative Ecology/Biology, Disease Ecology/ Epidemiology, Statistics, or closely related field at time of hire.
Strong quantitative skills and occupancy-related analysis; experience evaluating statistical models via simulation.
Knowledge or experience in disease ecology demonstrated in submitted application materials.
Experience publishing scientific papers associated with your work.
Experience / ability to communicate and collaborate well with a variety of partners.

The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: The project centers on exploring the challenges of managing plant diseases caused by phytoplasma and spiroplasma infections, with the aim of finding effective solutions. The bacteria lack cell walls and can penetrate plant phloem sieve cells, leading to serious diseases in key crops such as citrus and corn. Early diagnosis and sensitive pathogen detection are needed for successful disease management. Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will have the opportunity to conduct research that seeks to identify molecular and physiological markers that can improve early detection of phytoplasmas, ultimately helping to reduce phytoplasma-related diseases.

Learning Objectives: Under the guidance of a mentor, the fellow will have the opportunity to:

Gain insights into the unique genomic and pathological features of phytoplasmas and spiroplasmas;
Explore the physiological signals and gene pathways that regulate phytoplasma virulence and plant defense; and
Select and evaluate appropriate molecular markers for detecting phytoplasmas and spiroplasmas during the early stages of the disease.
Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Wei Wei (wei.wei@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: 2025/2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Student contractors will be selected for one primary duty, though opportunities to participate in additional study components may be available.

This position involves intensive field work in wetland and upland habitats. Primary duties may include nest searching; nest monitoring; vegetation sampling; capture and attachment of transmitters to multiple species of waterbirds, including ducks, shorebirds, pelicans, gulls, and cormorants; conducting waterbird and habitat surveys; collecting ecological and habitat data; identifying waterbirds; and assisting with the operation of government vehicles (including 4WD vehicles), kayaks, and ATVs. Additional responsibilities may include data entry, compilation, quality control, and organization of field data in spreadsheets and tabular formats. The ideal applicant will have an interest in waterbird and waterfowl ecology, wetland and upland habitats, and applied field research. Desired skills include experience with bird identification, nest searching, bird captures and handling, habitat surveys, or ecological field data collection. Applicants must be able to work independently and as part of a team, demonstrate strong organizational skills and attention to detail, and be willing to work long hours, including early mornings, evenings, at nighttime, and some weekends as needed. Previous experience with waterbird identification, nest searching, or field-based ecological data collection is desirable.

Work schedules will vary depending on field activities. These are paid student contractor positions, with compensation commensurate with the role and level of responsibility of the position on the team (range: $23.48 – $32.54/hr). The anticipated start dates will be between March 15 and April 1, 2026. Final end dates will depend on the project, but projects are likely to be finished by June 26.

This position will be based out of the USGS office in Dixon, California, and may include multi-day trips to remote locations for field work.

To qualify as a student contractor, applicants must be current undergraduate or graduate students, or recent graduates (within the past 12 months).

Applications will be reviewed as received, and the announcement will close on February 28, 2026 (or earlier if all positions are filled). Please send a resume, transcripts, list of references, and a list of relevant coursework to:

The Western Ecological Research Center (WERC) of the USGS has an immediate opening for eight student interns or recent graduates (within the past year) to work as part of a team collecting forest data in the Sierra Nevada. Six students will be crew members and two will be crew leaders. 

The students will be participating in a team effort to collect forest health, fire, and fuels data. Duties include measuring tree diameters and heights, recording fuels, mapping trees, and identifying insects and diseases in order to conduct tree mortality assessments. An interest in natural resources, experience hiking (backpacking experience strongly preferred), strong interpersonal and communication skills, and the ability to collect forest health, fire, and fuels data are required. Crew lead positions will require prior leadership experience and will have the additional responsibilities of crew safety, protocol training, field logistics, and compiling/processing data.  

Work will primarily be performed in the field. Locations include Sequoia National Park, Yosemite National Park, and surrounding National Forest Service land. Elevations range from approximately 5,000 – 12,000 feet. Crews will typically work four 10-hour days per week, although they may be required to work as many as eight days consecutively to accommodate trips into the wilderness. Field sites are in front country and back country locations with off trail travel and some backpacking required. Conditions will be variable, and crews will work in challenging conditions including burn areas, heat, cold, shrub fields, biting insects, and high elevation. Work will be conducted from May through September with the potential for flexibility based on students’ schedules.  
 These are paid student contractor positions. The level of education required is at least 1 year of college. Compensation is commensurate with the role and level of responsibility of the position on the team, ranging from approximately $16.73 (1 year of college) for basic crew work to $26.03 (recent BA/BS or MA/MS graduates) for an independent crew lead.  
 Duration of work will be for up to one year, with an estimated starting date of 5/18/2026 for crew members and 4/20/2026 for crew leads.  
 The people selected will be based out of the Sequoia Kings Canyon Field station in Three Rivers, CA.

Description
Job Summary/Basic Function: Lake Superior State University (LSSU) seeks qualified applicants for a tenure-track faculty position in Aquaculture starting in August 2026. This is a 9 month, tenure-track position in the School of Natural Resources that is funded through a partnership between LSSU and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) titled the Partnership for Aquaculture Research and Management (PARM). The PARM position has administrative (25%), research (45%), teaching and mentoring (25%), and service (5%) responsibilities, and will be responsible for supporting aquaculture initiatives that address university and MDNR interests. The core appointment is based on a 9-month academic contract. However, due to the year-round needs of the hatchery and the PARM program, the position includes additional expectations during the winter and summer terms, and these will be compensated by an additional stipend.
Administrative responsibilities include, but are not limited to, providing vision for and year-round oversight of CFRE Fish Hatchery operations, developing and managing the hatchery operational budget, supervising hatchery personnel, and working with internal and external partners to ensure smooth operation of the hatchery. Research responsibilities include creating an active, externally-funded research program in aquaculture that engages students and supports LSSU and MDNR research needs, publishing research results in peer-reviewed scientific journals, presenting at professional conferences, acquiring external funding for research, and maintaining and developing collaborative relationships with state, federal, and tribal agencies. Teaching responsibilities may include teaching Freshwater Fish Culture, Internship in Aquaculture, Apprenticeship in Fish Culture, and thesis mentoring (Senior Project and MS Project). Mentoring undergraduates and graduate students engaged in research is expected.
LSSU is a small (<2,000 undergraduate students) state university located in the beautiful Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The campus sits on the St. Marys River, the sole outflow of Lake Superior and international boundary with Canada, and provides numerous educational and professional opportunities in aquaculture, fisheries management, and aquatic ecology. Additionally, LSSU is surrounded by three Great Lakes and many state, provincial, and national forests and parks that provide tremendous recreational opportunities and a high quality of life.
The CFRE Fish Hatchery (https://www.lssu.edu/cfre/undergraduate-opportunities/hatchery/) houses a student-run Atlantic salmon hatchery, providing hands-on classroom opportunities. The Richard and Theresa Barch CFRE building, located adjacent to the hatchery, provides expanded research facilities, including an analytical lab and experimental mesocosms, along with a Great Lakes Discovery Center for K-12 education, all along the shores of the St. Marys River. The facility is uniquely positioned to build partnerships to advance Great Lakes education, research, and community engagement in the region. The Assistant Professor of Aquaculture position will play a key role in contributing to the growth of the CFRE and related student opportunities.
Success of students within the School of Natural Resources (SNR) stems from extensive interaction with faculty during hands-on labs, student research, and active student organizations. All students within the school are required to complete senior thesis research and they are encouraged to present their research at regional and national scientific conferences. Additionally, the SNR recently created an accelerated MS (4+1) program in Fisheries and Wildlife, which enables expanded research opportunities. Faculty also work closely in advising student clubs, including the nationally recognized Fisheries and Wildlife Club (student sub-unit of the American Fisheries Society). The successful candidate will be expected to mentor students engaged in undergraduate research, and contribute to university service, including advising student organizations.

Minimum Qualifications: Master’s or Doctoral degree in Aquaculture or closely related discipline appropriate to the assignment is required at the time of appointment. The successful applicant should have administrative experience and demonstrated ability or potential to conduct excellent research and mentor undergraduate and graduate students.

Preferred Qualifications: Experience teaching courses in aquaculture, familiarity with aquaculture of salmonids, experience including students in research, and providing professional opportunities for students outside of class. Experience with grant writing and acquisition of external funding.

Physical Demands: Be able to accompany students on field labs, actively lead and participate in field and hatchery activities; be able to lift up to 50 pounds; possess a valid driver’s license and operate a 4WD truck.

 *Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Physiology and Pathology of Tree Fruit Research Lab, located at a workstation in Hood River, Oregon.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: Pears, a ~$400M U.S. crop, constitute a significant economic crop for multiple states in the U.S., particularly Washington, Oregon, and California. Mucor piriformis (Mucor rot) can cause significant annual cold chain losses, reducing profit and, ultimately, pear industry viability. There are currently few effective control strategies for this disease. This project will develop validated quantification methods, pathogen resources, and control strategies, advancing the goals of the National Farm Security Action Plan to protect producers, safeguard rural economies, and preserve U.S. market access. The approach will include transcriptomics to quantify pathogen load in samples and metagenomics and bioinformatics to understand genetic diversity of the pathogen.  Potential areas of research include genomic epidemiology, ecological surveillance, and ecological modeling.

Learning Objectives: Through this fellowship, the successful applicant will gain valuable hands-on experience and develop expertise in laboratory and cold chain research. The participant will have the opportunity to learn and enhance skills in the following areas:

Develop and validate qPCR methods for detecting in environmental and dump tank samples.
Understand genetic diversity of Mucor piriformis.
Learning to identify high priority geographical regions for continued sampling
Scientific Communication: The fellow will gain experience in disseminating research findings through peer-reviewed journal articles, technical reports, and presentations at scientific and stakeholder meetings, building skills in professional communication and knowledge sharing.
Through these project opportunities, the fellow will expand their expertise in plant pathology, molecular biology, microbiology, experimental design, statistical analysis, and scientific communication. This comprehensive training will prepare the participant for future roles in agricultural research, environmental science, and related fields.

Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is John Bennett (john.bennett@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: 2026, as soon as possible. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $70,000 - $75,000 annually.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Position Description
The Collaborative Conservation & Adaptation Planning and the Wetland and Riparian Ecology labs at Auburn University are seeking a full-time Postdoctoral Research Fellow to join the “Building the resilience of Gulf Coast blue economies in a changing world: A multiple case study” research initiative, which has been recommended for funding by Mississippi Alabama Sea Grant (*this post was made in anticipation of receiving final approval from the NOAA grants office). This mixed-methods project will constructively evaluate the long-term impacts of Sea Grant’s Gulf Resilience Community of Practice (CoP) and explore how resilience is understood, experienced, and implemented across a spectrum of coastal economies in Mississippi and Alabama.

The postdoc will work closely with Dr. Matthew Jurjonas (PI and Assistant Professor, Conservation Social Science) and Dr. Chris Anderson (Co-PI and Professor, Coastal Wetland Ecology) to co-lead project implementation. The position emphasizes community-based fieldwork, qualitative interviewing, focus groups, and comparative case study analysis, with three focal communities who have already expressed support for the project—representing a range of traditional, hybrid, and tourism-based blue economies. In addition, this position will help co-design a workshop at the CoP annual meeting designed to share results, foster dialogue, and strategize new directions for today’s changing coastal resilience context toward the end of the project.

The position will start in the Spring 2026, and the starting salary is $55,000. In addition, the position includes an annual research and travel budget to support fieldwork, professional development, and dissemination activities.

 *Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Soybean Maize Germplasm Pathology and Genetics Research Unit, located in Urbana, Illinois.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: This fellowship will focus on germplasm curation, including maintenance, regeneration, distribution, and quality control. Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will optimize workflows for phenotypic germplasm data collection and seek to improve germplasm use efficiency. The participant will gain experience using multiple databases for inventorying, tracking distributions, and managing phenotypic data to maintain identity preservation of the soybean germplasm collection holdings, and will have opportunities to improve database utilization. Under mentorship, the participant will conduct experiments for phenotypic germplasm evaluation using mobile devices and high-throughput methods such as drones.  Phenotypic evaluation will align agronomic traits with allele frequency using advanced statistics. The participant will have the opportunity to collaborate with the soybean breeding community to define scientific thresholds for duplicate germplasm accessions that supports genetic diversity while removing redundancy. The participant will learn how phenotypic datasets are integrated with genomic data for association analyses, genomic selection, and AI-driven methods, including machine learning and deep learning, to enhance germplasm utilization.

Learning Objectives: During this appointment, the participant will learn or enhance their skills in the following:

Apply principles of germplasm management and genetic diversity to real-world soybean genetic resource and breeding challenges.
Gain hands-on experience with mobile and drone-based phenotypic data collection and quality control workflows.
Develop skills in data integration for genomic association studies, genomic selection, and AI-driven predictive modeling.
Learn to implement machine learning and deep learning approaches for optimizing germplasm use efficiency.
Strengthen scientific communication, collaboration, and confidence through preparation of technical reports and collaborative projects.
Enhance problem-solving and critical thinking skills while working in a multidisciplinary research environment.
Mentor(s): The mentors for this opportunity are Zhanyou Xu (Zhanyou.Xu@usda.gov), Lilian Miranda (lilian.miranda@usda.gov), and Neha Kothari (neha.kothari@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.
