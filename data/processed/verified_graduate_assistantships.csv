Description
The Fish Ecology Laboratory in the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology invites applications for a funded graduate student to study questions related to the use of Tiger Muskellunge (sterile Northern Pike and Muskellunge hybrids) as biological control of introduced fish species. Introduced and invasive species are some of the greatest risks to conservation and management of native fishes. Stocking sterile fishes that are highly predatory (e.g., Tiger Muskellunge, triploid Walleye) is increasingly popular to control populations of undesirable fishes while maintaining the long-term goals of native species conservation. However, stocking of these sterile predators may not be compatible with other management activities. The successful candidate will design and conduct research to develop a set of best practices when using Tiger Muskellunge as biological control. Research components may include harmonizing long-term Colorado State data, field-based experiments, gut content and stable isotope analyses, bioenergetic modeling, population modeling, angler surveys, and quantitative literature review. The successful candidate will collaborate extensively with researchers at CSU as well as Colorado Parks and Wildlife researchers and biologists, who will be key partners in the project. 

Candidates must have: 
-        A MSc degree in fisheries, ecology, biology, or equivalent 
-        Demonstrated excellence in science communication (scientific writing, presentations) and quantitative skills 
 Ideal candidates will have some combination of experience in: 
-        Population modeling 
-        Management and analysis of large datasets 
-        Bioenergetic modeling 
-        Stable isotope analyses 
-        Fish ecology 
-        Field research 
-        Working with staff from agencies, non-governmental organizations, anglers, etc 
-        Familiarity with common programs used for analyses (e.g., R software) 
 Funding: The project is conditionally funded for 4 years through a combination of support from Colorado Parks and Wildlife and teaching assistantships. Funding includes graduate student stipend (~$36,000 USD per year), health insurance, and tuition. 

Application: Interested applicants should submit a letter of interest (1-2 pages) and a CV as one PDF file to: Dr. Zoe Almeida, l.zoe.almeida@colostate.edu and Dr. Jesse Lepak (please use subject line “PhD application: Bio Control”). Finalists will be invited to apply to the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology through the Colorado State University Graduate School (see https://warnercnr.colostate.edu/fwcb/graduate-study/how-to-apply/).

Description
We are searching for a PhD student to lead a new experimental study investigating how coyotes and wild pigs influence the behavior of deer and other mammals in the southeastern United States. Coyotes have relatively recently colonized the southeast, taking on the role of the largest carnivore across much of the region and exerting top-down effects on the native large herbivore (white-tailed deer) and other trophic levels. At the same time, wild pigs have spread across much of the southeast, and our recent research suggests they are impacting predator-prey dynamics in this system. However, disentangling the relative effects of coyotes and wild pigs individually on ecosystem processes has heretofore been limited due to the fact that both species occur ubiquitously across any area where they co-occur, i.e., studying the effects of one species in isolation from the other has been impossible. Therefore, with state and federal partners, we will be using large (100 acre) exclosures that will selectively exclude each of these target species. 

The student is expected to take part in this exciting new project (exclosures were just constructed) by developing research questions related specifically to deer and other mammalian responses to our experimental design. Within the study area we are placing GPS tracking collars on coyotes, deer and wild pigs, allowing the student to investigate questions regarding how removal of predation risk and/or risk of interacting with the dominant competitor (i.e., wild pigs) impact deer movement behavior, stress physiology, maternal care and fawn survival. We also have an extensive camera trap array and drift fences in place, making the system well suited to assess community-level responses by carnivores and other trophic levels. 

Applicants are required to have an MS in wildlife ecology or a related field, previous experience in studying the ecology of wildlife in a field setting, be a US citizen and have a valid US driver’s license. Top applicants will have a strong interest in the ecology of large mammals and their impact on other trophic levels, as well as evidence of strong scientific writing and basic statistics.  Applicants should submit a cover letter, CV, contact information for 3 references, unofficial transcripts, and a scientific writing sample as a single PDF titled “LastName_PhDapplication” to djachow@clemson.edu prior to September 22, 2025.  The selected student would start at Clemson in January 2026. 

The selected student will be awarded a 4-year graduate research assistantship (starting at $30,000/year, health benefits, along with tuition waiver) to attend Clemson University as a Fellow in the Clemson Boone and Crockett University Program. As a Boone and Crockett Fellow, the student will join a network of fellows at other universities with Boone and Crockett Programs and have access to several exclusive professional development opportunities. The student will be advised by Dr. David Jachowski within the Department of Forestry and Wildlife Conservation, with external advising from Dr. John Kilgo of the U.S. Forest Service. Clemson University is the largest public land grant university in the state of South Carolina and nationally recognized as an R1 (“very high research activity”) institution. Clemson is a small town located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains and along the shores of Lake Hartwell. Campus is surrounded by the 17,500-acre Clemson Experimental Forest, providing abundant opportunities for recreation, research and education.

Description
 California and the west are in the midst of a wildfire crisis due to an increase in catastrophic fires and decrease in good fire. One solution to these dueling crises is prescribed fire, and there is broad political support to increase its use. As the number of prescribed fires and their acreage increase in California, understanding their goals and effects are important. This research may help California Central Coast managers conduct better prescribed fires with their limited burn windows and capacity.
The student will be part of a collaborative, interdisciplinary team who evaluates prescribed fire effects on existing research and monitoring projects, which could be a MS thesis and peer-reviewed publication. Potential prescribed fire partners include Cal Fire units, UC Cooperative Extension, Prescribed Burn Associations, non-profits, private landowners, state and federal parks, Tribes, and more. Students may have an opportunity to pursue a prescribed fire project outside of the current research scope. Projects will generally be focused in the South Bay and Central Coast.

MS students would work with Dr. Kate Wilkin in the Biological Sciences Department’s Ecology and Evolution program at San Jose State University. Students would participate in the new Wildfire Interdisciplinary Research Center, which was recently awarded a NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC). WIRC provides potential internal research funding and interdisciplinary collaborations between ecology and social scientists, climatologists, fire weather, fire behavior modeling, combustion engineer, fire behavior monitoring, and remote sensing. 
Prescribed fire research includes:

Evaluate efficacy of novel field-based and remote sensing-based monitoring methods
Coastal prairie restoration
Photoload expansion to coastal prairies
Post-treatment herbaceous diversity and shrub status
Chaparral fire management


Other research and projects in the lab includes:

Home Ignition Zone (HIZ)
Fuel breaks and evacuation route clearance
Pyrodiversity
Youth fire education 



Funding: 
1st year funds available through existing grants. We will apply for 2nd year funds together. Students are expected to seek additional funding and tuition stipends may be available through competitive Biology Department teaching positions.
