Work Term: September 1, 2025 - May 31, 2026
Host: Alaska Venture Fund
Position Title: Climate and Energy Transition Fellow
Location: Anchorage, AK
Contact: Erin Harrington (erin.harrington@alaskaventure.org)


About Alaska Venture Fund:


Alaska Venture Fund (https://alaskaventure.org/) is a philanthropic partner and social-change incubator building a more sustainable future for Alaska and beyond. We believe that by pursuing bold ideas, choosing sustainable strategies, and investing in new economies, Alaska can become the blueprint for a more just and prosperous future. Though we are a non-profit, we approach our work with the spirit of a venture fund, driving for major impact and tolerating risk in the service of transformational change. 


Position Summary:


The Fellow will play a pivotal role in supporting Alaska Venture Fund’s Carbon and Climate Initiative. This role involves a blend of research, policy analysis, program coordination, and communications support to advance decarbonization pathways and renewable energy solutions in Alaska. The Fellow will work closely with the climate transition team, Indigenous partners, and cross-sector stakeholders to promote sustainable climate and energy practices.



Key Responsibilities:


Conduct research on decarbonization pathways and renewable energy trends specific to Alaska.
Perform policy and data analysis related to decarbonization of the Alaska economy and full use of Alaska’s vast resources in service of the climate transition, including renewable energy adoption and integration and natural climate solutions (NCS).
Support AVF’s initiative to identify pathways toward carbon and greenhouse gas neutrality in Alaska.
Assist the Communications Team in developing and disseminating reports, policy briefs, and content that advances AVF’s climate and energy transition goals.
Serve as a key implementer for special projects related to AVF’s climate and energy portfolio, potentially to include power mapping and supporting build-out of networks of influence. 
Provide general programmatic support, including project coordination.
Support meeting planning and coordination, including agenda development, stakeholder engagement, and follow-up documentation.

Bachelor’s degree in environmental studies, public policy, energy systems, or related fields
Strong research and analytical skills with the ability to synthesize complex information.
Self-starter with the ability to take direction, then work independently, set goals, and work toward them.
Familiarity with climate policy, renewable energy technologies, and natural climate solutions is beneficial but not required.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills.
Experience in project coordination or running special projects is a plus


Keys to Success

Initiative and ingenuity: You leverage resources creatively to solve problems and dive right in to take a concept from idea to implementation. You often consult with others, but you can also propose solutions in the best interest of the [school, campaign, organization] and get things rolling without much guidance. 
Ownership and resilience: You care deeply about getting results. You gather information, seek input, and drive work forward to the finish line. You think 3 (or 30) steps ahead to develop solutions, anticipate problems, and course-correct when needed. You hold a high bar even when things are hectic and bounce back from setbacks by turning each hurdle into a learning opportunity.
Adaptability and problem solving: You are always ready to take advantage of unexpected opportunities and address obstacles. You look for the root of both simple and complex problems, so you can seek solutions. You approach work with a spirit of “yes” and adapt as things change, which they often do.


Location: Anchorage. This position may involve travel to rural and remote communities in Alaska. The role will be hybrid, with some required work days in AVF’s Anchorage office and some days possible for work from home. 

Work Authorization: We are unable to assist in obtaining a work visa.

Who We Are

https://www.safariclub.org/

https://safariclubfoundation.org/

Hunting is an ancient tradition passed down from the earliest times of man to the present day. Hunters participate directly in the natural world and care enough to make sure that it continues in all of its awesome beauty and diversity.

Safari Club International (SCI) is a U.S.-based organization of more than 50,000 hunters and nearly 200 chapters worldwide, dedicated to protecting the right to hunt and to promote wildlife conservation. Between SCI and its sister organization, the SCI Foundation, we have put more than $70 Million on the ground for conservation since 2000. In the U.S. and abroad, hunters are part of a system that keeps the rivers, forests and fields intact and maintains the wildlife.

Safari Club International Foundation (SCIF) has a 20-year history of being a leader in science-based, research-driven solutions to real problems facing wildlife conservation and sustainable use of wildlife resources. SCIF is active in domestic and international wildlife conservation, including with CITES and the IUCN, and is the host of the annual African Wildlife Consultative Forum.

Description
*Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), located in Beltsville, Maryland.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: The project centers on exploring the challenges of managing plant diseases caused by phytoplasma and spiroplasma infections, with the aim of finding effective solutions. These bacteria lack cell walls and can penetrate plant phloem sieve cells, leading to serious diseases in key crops such as citrus and corn. Early diagnosis and sensitive pathogen detection are essential for successful disease management. Therefore, this study seeks to identify molecular and physiological markers that can improve early detection of phytoplasmas, ultimately helping to reduce phytoplasma-related diseases.

Learning Objectives: Under the guidance of a mentor, the fellow will have the opportunity to learn how to:

Gain insights into the unique genomic and pathological features of phytoplasmas and spiroplasmas
Explore the physiological signals and gene pathways that regulate phytoplasma virulence and plant defense
Select and evaluate appropriate molecular markers for detecting phytoplasmas and spiroplasmas during the early stages of the disease
Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Wei Wei (wei.wei@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: September 1, 2025. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $45,000 - $85,000 annually.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Questions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process, please email ORISE.ARS.Northeast@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.
