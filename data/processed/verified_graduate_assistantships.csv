RIO GRANDE CUTTHROAT TROUT PHD ASSISTANTSHIP

Description & project background: 

The Pregler Lab at New Mexico State University in the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Ecology invites applications for a PhD research assistantship focused on Rio Grande cutthroat trout conservation. The successful applicant will begin in the Fall 2026 semester.

Rio Grande cutthroat trout (RGCT) are the southernmost species of cutthroat trout and have experienced a severe decline in both range and abundance, now occupying only ~12 percent of its historical distribution and requires targeted management interventions to support recovery. Major components of the recovery plan detail the need to secure extant populations and reintroduce individuals within their native range in Colorado and New Mexico. Recent efforts to date include development of a multi-source, genetically diverse broodstock for the Rio Grande basin that is used for reintroduction efforts.

Individuals from this multi-source broodstock were stocked at multiple sites throughout the recently restored Rio Costilla watershed which represents one of the largest native fish restoration projects in the country. While recent research has shown that this composite broodstock is more genetically diverse compared to using single source populations there is a need to evaluate how these fish are performing in the wild. The present project has a number of goals:

          1. Evaluate genetic structure and diversity of reintroduced Rio Costilla RGCT populations
                     a. There is also opportunity to develop questions with demographic monitoring data in this system.
          2. Genetic assessment of Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos basins. 
                     a. Results will help inform multi-source broodstock development for Canadian & Pecos basins and identify additional source populations for Rio Grande basin.
                     b. Results will also provide an updated genetic assessment for RGCT.
          3. There are additional opportunities for the student to develop their own questions using genetic and demographic data.

This project is a collaborative effort funded by the New Mexico Department of Wildlife and there may be potential to collaborate with other university researchers and agencies. Benefits include a salary range of ~$28-29k/year, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance. Funding will also be available for conference travel, workshop training for data analyses, and safety training (e.g., wilderness first aid). The hired candidate will begin in Fall 2026 and will be based at NMSU in Las Cruces, NM.

How to apply: If interested, please compile the following: (1) a statement of interest that describes your educational and research background, as well as your research interests and how this position fits in your career goals (2) curriculum vitae or resume, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts compiled in a single PDF and save as ‘Lastname_RGCT_PhD.pdf’.  Applicants are also asked to upload a writing sample in the application portal. Applications should be submitted through the airtable linked here:  https://airtable.com/app3jNqbQZsYstwx7/pagrpU5GqaI6FnSTg/form 

Applications are due 03/18/26 by 11:59p MT. You can learn more about the Pregler Lab at https://preglerlab.com and any questions about the position can be sent to Dr. Kasey Pregler at kpregler@nmsu.edu.   

Qualifications: 

Required: B.S. in fisheries, biology, or related field and possession of a valid U.S. driver’s license. The successful applicant must also meet the minimum requirements for admission to the NMSU Graduate School (3.0 GPA in last two years of undergrad). Applicants should also have demonstrated excellent written and oral communication skills, and an ability to work independently. 

Preference will be given to applicants with an M.S. degree in fisheries, biology, or related field and have experience working in the backcountry and are willing to lead field work crews in backcountry conditions.

Successful candidates will have proficiency in R, and an interest in genetics and working with large datasets. They should also demonstrate the ability to work as part of a team and have a willingness to lead field work crews in remote backcountry locations. Applicants with experience in fish ecology, statistical & genetic analysis, and hierarchical modeling are encouraged to apply.

PhD Scholarship
Transforming Climate Action – Uncertain Seas 
 
A PhD Scholarship is available at the Centre for Fisheries Ecosystems Research, Fisheries & Marine Institute, Memorial University, St. John’s, NL, Canada.

Transforming Climate Action is a seven year, $397 million collaboration among Dalhousie University, Laval University, University Québec at Rimouski, and Memorial University. The largest research theme within Transforming Climate Action is Reducing Uncertainties in Carbon Cycling in the Northwest Atlantic Seas (Uncertain Seas). The goal of Uncertain Seas is to better constrain the role of the ocean in the Earth’s climate system by reducing uncertainties with physical and biogeochemical processes that control the global ocean carbon cycle. The focus is on the Northwest Atlantic gateway as a major contributor to ocean carbon uptake and sequestration, particularly with respect to the biological carbon pump.
We are seeking a PhD Student to estimate carbon fluxes in the Northwest Atlantic from Earth system and ecosystem models. As a part of Transforming Climate Action, there will be opportunities to participate in workshops with other graduate students from the four institutions. There will also be opportunities for research visits to collaborating labs and conference travel. There may be opportunities to participate in research expeditions, although not a requirement.

Transforming Climate Action – Uncertain Seas 
 
A PhD Scholarship is available at the Centre for Fisheries Ecosystems Research, Fisheries & Marine Institute, Memorial University, St. John’s, NL, Canada.

Transforming Climate Action is a seven year, $397 million collaboration among Dalhousie University, Laval University, University Québec at Rimouski, and Memorial University. The largest research theme within Transforming Climate Action is Reducing Uncertainties in Carbon Cycling in the Northwest Atlantic Seas (Uncertain Seas). The goal of Uncertain Seas is to better constrain the role of the ocean in the Earth’s climate system by reducing uncertainties with physical and biogeochemical processes that control the global ocean carbon cycle. The focus is on the Northwest Atlantic gateway as a major contributor to ocean carbon uptake and sequestration, particularly with respect to the biological carbon pump.
We are seeking a PhD Student to estimate carbon fluxes in the Northwest Atlantic from Earth system and ecosystem models. As a part of Transforming Climate Action, there will be opportunities to participate in workshops with other graduate students from the four institutions. There will also be opportunities for research visits to collaborating labs and conference travel. There may be opportunities to participate in research expeditions, although not a requirement.

Description
A graduate assistantship for a master’s student is expected to be funded at Colorado State University (Fort Collins, CO) working with Dr. Brian D. Gerber (https://bgerber123.github.io/) at the Colorado Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and wildlife researchers at Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The graduate research assistantship will cover university tuition, fees, health coverage, and includes a pre-tax monthly pay of $3000/month. The position is expected to start Fall 2026 and be funded through December 2028.

Study Context: Sex and age class are important demographic parameters used in population modeling, in which the results help guide management decisions and annual harvest quotas of large mammals (e.g., elk, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, mule deer). This work will help develop new methodology and workflows that will aid Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s objective of producing robust empirical demographic data and population estimates for harvested wildlife. 

Focus: The focus of this study will be to collect data on the size distribution of elk sex and age classes (cow, calf, bull) to train and test a predictive approach using AI algorithms (developed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife) to classify animals from high-resolution aerial imagery. Field observations and size measurements (via 3D camera) will be collected to help test the accuracy of AI predictions. An additional avenue of exploration may be data collection and AI classification of sex/age class from camera trap images. The student will be expected to develop a project proposal outlining study objectives in coordination with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and a graduate committee at Colorado State University. The student will focus on technological and software workflows to meet study objectives, however, there will likely be field work opportunities as well (e.g., field observations, drone/aerial surveys). Given the trajectory of the wildlife field, the skills gained in this study will likely be desirable for future employers. 

 Preferred Qualifications: 

-          Ungulate field research experience in the intermountain west
-          Clear interest or experience developing data analysis workflows
-          Clear interest or experience advancing technological innovation (hardware/software) in wildlife science

Research Project: Aspergillus flavus, a common pathogen of maize globally, is especially problematic in the southeastern region of the United States. It causes ear-rot and contaminates grain with aflatoxin, a highly carcinogenic mycotoxin. Susceptibility to A. flavus infection and aflatoxin accumulation is exacerbated in the presence of biotic and abiotic stresses that commonly occur in corn production environments. Since inheritance of resistance to Aspergillus ear rot is controlled by many QTL across the genome, innovative research will be required to develop and deploy commercially valuable hybrids possessing stable resistance. The fellow will be involved in a research project to

Screen and characterize maize germplasm from different sources to identify germplasm with resistance to Aspergillus flavus kernel infection and subsequent aflatoxin accumulation;
Incorporate resistance to A. flavus into agronomically acceptable maize inbred lines with improved combining ability for yield, and alignment with industry heterotic patterns; and
Discover maize inbred lines that are resilient to extreme weather events and more productive under sustainable management systems.
Learning Objectives: The participant will gain skills in laboratory methodologies, experimental design, maize breeding, and data analysis. Through the course of the project, the participant will gain knowledge of current issues and latest research at the intersection of maize pathology and breeding with a focus on Aspergillus ear rot disease through exposure to the lab's researchers, as well as academic and industry collaborators.

Description
ROJECT TITLE: Pinyon Jay response to juniper management, Deschutes County, Oregon.

BACKGROUND: Pinyon Jays (PIJA, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) have experienced significant, range-wide declines over the past 50 years, and are currently under Status Review for ESA listing. Deschutes County, Oregon represents the northwestern-most extent of the species range and lies far outside the extant range of pinyon pine species. Extensive treatments of juniper woodlands have been expedited throughout western states for restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, sage grouse habitat, and altered fire regimes. However, we lack clear understanding of how these treatments impact PIJA populations.  

Management priorities for PIJA in Oregon include assessing impacts of juniper treatments on PIJA and determining state-wide distribution. The primary goals of this project are to experimentally study how juniper treatments impact occupancy, habitat use, and nesting of PIJA on BLM lands in Deschutes County, Oregon. We are implementing a before-after-control-impact study and use bioacoustics monitoring, point counts, and nest searching methods. The MS project will focus on at least one component of the project. This work is in partnership with the East Cascades Bird Alliance, US Fish and Wildlife, and Deschutes BLM. We also contribute to the PIJA Western Working Group and the PIJA Conservation Action Strategy (CAS). The MS candidate will be expected to coordinate with and contribute findings to larger range-wide intiatives. 

LOCATION & PROGRAM: This position supports a student in the Masters of Science in Natural Resources at Oregon Tech in Klamath Falls, OR. Our MS program started in 2024 and is in the Natural Sciences Department, which also encompasses the MS of Medical Science program, and BS programs in Environmental Science and Biology-Health Science. Program description and requirements are here https://www.oit.edu/academics/degrees/natural-resources 

SUPPORT: This position includes the opportunity for a Graduate Teaching Assistantship for the Academic Years 2026-2026 and 2027-2028.

BACKGROUND: Pinyon Jays (PIJA, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) have experienced significant, range-wide declines over the past 50 years, and are currently under Status Review for ESA listing. Deschutes County, Oregon represents the northwestern-most extent of the species range and lies far outside the extant range of pinyon pine species. Extensive treatments of juniper woodlands have been expedited throughout western states for restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, sage grouse habitat, and altered fire regimes. However, we lack clear understanding of how these treatments impact PIJA populations.  

Management priorities for PIJA in Oregon include assessing impacts of juniper treatments on PIJA and determining state-wide distribution. The primary goals of this project are to experimentally study how juniper treatments impact occupancy, habitat use, and nesting of PIJA on BLM lands in Deschutes County, Oregon. We are implementing a before-after-control-impact study and use bioacoustics monitoring, point counts, and nest searching methods. The MS project will focus on at least one component of the project. This work is in partnership with the East Cascades Bird Alliance, US Fish and Wildlife, and Deschutes BLM. We also contribute to the PIJA Western Working Group and the PIJA Conservation Action Strategy (CAS). The MS candidate will be expected to coordinate with and contribute findings to larger range-wide intiatives.

The Collaborative Conservation & Adaptation Planning and the Wetland and Riparian Ecology labs at Auburn University are seeking a full-time Postdoctoral Research Fellow to join the “Building the resilience of Gulf Coast blue economies in a changing world: A multiple case study” research initiative, which has been recommended for funding by Mississippi Alabama Sea Grant (*this post was made in anticipation of receiving final approval from the NOAA grants office). This mixed-methods project will constructively evaluate the long-term impacts of Sea Grant’s Gulf Resilience Community of Practice (CoP) and explore how resilience is understood, experienced, and implemented across a spectrum of coastal economies in Mississippi and Alabama.

The postdoc will work closely with Dr. Matthew Jurjonas (PI and Assistant Professor, Conservation Social Science) and Dr. Chris Anderson (Co-PI and Professor, Coastal Wetland Ecology) to co-lead project implementation. The position emphasizes community-based fieldwork, qualitative interviewing, focus groups, and comparative case study analysis, with three focal communities who have already expressed support for the project—representing a range of traditional, hybrid, and tourism-based blue economies. In addition, this position will help co-design a workshop at the CoP annual meeting designed to share results, foster dialogue, and strategize new directions for today’s changing coastal resilience context toward the end of the project.

The position will start in the Spring 2026, and the starting salary is $55,000. In addition, the position includes an annual research and travel budget to support fieldwork, professional development, and dissemination activities.

Key Responsibilities
Develop and implement a program evaluation protocol that constructively evaluates the impact, potential opportunities, and future directions of the Resilience CoP.
