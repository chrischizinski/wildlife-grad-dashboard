Description
Mountain ecosystems are among the regions most susceptible to temperature warming, and species adapted to alpine ecosystems are predicted to face local extinctions via physiological and/or behavioral intolerance to rapid increases in temperature. Persistence of alpine avifauna will depend upon the ability of individuals to seek out microhabitats that provide cool refugia while engaging in behaviors that reduce energy expenditure. Identifying such microclimate refugia and understanding how alpine birds use them will help inform management strategies for conserving alpine ecosystems in the face of rapid temperature warming. This funded PhD project focuses on two focal species, Rock Ptarmigan and Rock Partridge, using state-of-the-art GPS tracking technology to quantify fine-scale movement patterns, as well as climate monitoring at study sites and land surface temperature mapping using a thermal drone. The project is located in the Swiss Alps and has completed two field seasons, with fieldwork projected to continue for an additional 1-2 years. 

The successful PhD Candidate will have access to the full study data set, with the opportunity to develop new field and/or analytical components depending upon logistics, expertise and interest. The Candidate must hold a MSc degree in biology or equivalent and ideally will show a strong interest in conservation science, environmental management and spatial analyses. 

Additional preferred (but not required) skills include: field experience studying birds or other vertebrates in montane landscapes, strong quantitative background with ability and interest to rapidly gain new skillsets related to the joint analysis of animal movement, climate, and remote sensing data, and knowledge of French and/or German. 

The project will be co-advised as a collaboration between Prof. Dr. Raphaël Arlettaz at University of Bern Division of Conservation Biology (Switzerland) and Assistant Professor Dr. Ian Ausprey at Texas A&M University Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology (USA). The Candidate will spend the first year at Uni Bern and the second two years at Texas A&M University and must be willing and able to commit to this schedule (exact timing negotiable). The PhD will be defended and granted at Uni Bern. 

Start: January 2026. Duration: 3 years, with possible prolongation. Salary according to SNSF rules. 

Applications must be submitted to ian.ausprey@ag.tamu.edu and should include a motivation letter describing your interests, experience and relevance for this position, a CV (including a list of publications if available), abstract of MSc thesis, and contact information for three professional references (institution, email, and phone number).

The application deadline is September 7th, 2025, with online interviews during the second half of September 2025.

Description
 Graduate Assistantship (M.S.), Grassland Plant Ecology 
 I am seeking a highly motivated individual to join a collaborative team studying the role of a dominant grazer in replanted, native grasslands.  The project utilizes sites that are part of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)—one of the largest grassland restoration initiatives in the U.S.  For example in Kansas, the CRP program has re-established approximately 1 million acres of native grassland; however, most of these sites do not include a dominant grazer despite the critical role that bison historically played in these systems.  Our project tests whether strategic cattle-grazing can enhance the conservation benefits to native plant communities and bird habitat in short and tallgrass prairie regions (Colorado and Kansas).  Two specific project objectives for this graduate position are to 1) quantify how grazers influence plant structural heterogeneity in ways that may improve habitat for wildlife and 2) examine how grazers influence the re-establishment of native plants.  
 This M.S. position requires someone who is self-motivated, works well with a team of field researchers, and has a strong interest in ecology.  The project will involve extensive fieldwork in Kansas and Colorado particularly during the summers.  Some knowledge of grassland plants is preferred, but strong students with the aptitude to learn plants quickly will also be considered.  Because we will be collaborating with private landowners, experience working in the United States is required as well as proficiency in spoken and written English.  Applicants should have an undergraduate degree in ecology, biology, or a related field and must meet the requirements for admission at Wichita State University.  Successful applicants will receive a 2-year assistantship with an annual stipend of $25,000 along with a tuition waiver and health benefits. This position begins January 2026.   To apply, email your CV, a transcript, and a letter describing your research interests and future goals to Dr. Greg Houseman (greg.houseman@wichita.edu).  An unofficial transcript will suffice for the initial application with an official copy needed if accepted into the program.  You do not need to apply to the Graduate School until you have been accepted into my lab.  Review of applications will begin Sept 15, 2025 and will continue until the positions is filled.  Please contact me if you have any questions!
