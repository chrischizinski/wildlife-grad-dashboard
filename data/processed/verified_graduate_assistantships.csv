USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNWRS) located in Wenatchee, Washington.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: This project will evaluate smoke emissions over a broad range of fuel, fuel moisture, and meteorological conditions and prescribed, cultural, and wildfire burn events. Using available software platforms, smoke emission factors and total smoke production by factor will be accounted for and differenced for the range of burn conditions as above. This research will involve a collaborative process with Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forests and create geospatial tools for wildfire, prescribed burning, and cultural burning related smoke trade-off analyses and quantitative forest landscape restoration and decision support. Results and findings will be submitted to one or more leading peer-reviewed journals, and presentations will be provided to Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest and other partners, along with the databases we create. The geospatial smoke tradeoffs dataset can then be used in project planning.

Learning Objectives: The fellow will develop professionally while engaging in research-operational partnerships and learning about systems involving forest fuels and fire emissions modeling. They will gain experience with modeling, coding, and database management in support of a complex, multi-model ecological forecasting workflow.

Description
Mountain ecosystems are among the regions most susceptible to temperature warming, and species adapted to alpine ecosystems are predicted to face local extinctions via physiological and/or behavioral intolerance to rapid increases in temperature. Persistence of alpine avifauna will depend upon the ability of individuals to seek out microhabitats that provide cool refugia while engaging in behaviors that reduce energy expenditure. Identifying such microclimate refugia and understanding how alpine birds use them will help inform management strategies for conserving alpine ecosystems in the face of rapid temperature warming. This funded PhD project focuses on two focal species, Rock Ptarmigan and Rock Partridge, using state-of-the-art GPS tracking technology to quantify fine-scale movement patterns, as well as climate monitoring at study sites and land surface temperature mapping using a thermal drone. The project is located in the Swiss Alps and has completed two field seasons, with fieldwork projected to continue for an additional 1-2 years. 

The successful PhD Candidate will have access to the full study data set, with the opportunity to develop new field and/or analytical components depending upon logistics, expertise and interest. The Candidate must hold a MSc degree in biology or equivalent and ideally will show a strong interest in conservation science, environmental management and spatial analyses. 

Additional preferred (but not required) skills include: field experience studying birds or other vertebrates in montane landscapes, strong quantitative background with ability and interest to rapidly gain new skillsets related to the joint analysis of animal movement, climate, and remote sensing data, and knowledge of French and/or German. 

The project will be co-advised as a collaboration between Prof. Dr. Raphaël Arlettaz at University of Bern Division of Conservation Biology (Switzerland) and Assistant Professor Dr. Ian Ausprey at Texas A&M University Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology (USA). The Candidate will spend the first year at Uni Bern and the second two years at Texas A&M University and must be willing and able to commit to this schedule (exact timing negotiable). The PhD will be defended and granted at Uni Bern. 

Start: January 2026. Duration: 3 years, with possible prolongation. Salary according to SNSF rules. 

Applications must be submitted to ian.ausprey@ag.tamu.edu and should include a motivation letter describing your interests, experience and relevance for this position, a CV (including a list of publications if available), abstract of MSc thesis, and contact information for three professional references (institution, email, and phone number).

The application deadline is September 7th, 2025, with online interviews during the second half of September 2025.

Description
 Graduate Assistantship (M.S.), Grassland Plant Ecology 
 I am seeking a highly motivated individual to join a collaborative team studying the role of a dominant grazer in replanted, native grasslands.  The project utilizes sites that are part of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)—one of the largest grassland restoration initiatives in the U.S.  For example in Kansas, the CRP program has re-established approximately 1 million acres of native grassland; however, most of these sites do not include a dominant grazer despite the critical role that bison historically played in these systems.  Our project tests whether strategic cattle-grazing can enhance the conservation benefits to native plant communities and bird habitat in short and tallgrass prairie regions (Colorado and Kansas).  Two specific project objectives for this graduate position are to 1) quantify how grazers influence plant structural heterogeneity in ways that may improve habitat for wildlife and 2) examine how grazers influence the re-establishment of native plants.  
 This M.S. position requires someone who is self-motivated, works well with a team of field researchers, and has a strong interest in ecology.  The project will involve extensive fieldwork in Kansas and Colorado particularly during the summers.  Some knowledge of grassland plants is preferred, but strong students with the aptitude to learn plants quickly will also be considered.  Because we will be collaborating with private landowners, experience working in the United States is required as well as proficiency in spoken and written English.  Applicants should have an undergraduate degree in ecology, biology, or a related field and must meet the requirements for admission at Wichita State University.  Successful applicants will receive a 2-year assistantship with an annual stipend of $25,000 along with a tuition waiver and health benefits. This position begins January 2026.   To apply, email your CV, a transcript, and a letter describing your research interests and future goals to Dr. Greg Houseman (greg.houseman@wichita.edu).  An unofficial transcript will suffice for the initial application with an official copy needed if accepted into the program.  You do not need to apply to the Graduate School until you have been accepted into my lab.  Review of applications will begin Sept 15, 2025 and will continue until the positions is filled.  Please contact me if you have any questions! 
 Wichita State University is a research-intensive university set in an urban area (~540,000 people including surrounding suburbs) yet close to numerous high quality grasslands including the iconic Flint Hills region. Wichita offers many opportunities for cultural/artistic activities and low cost-of-living. The Department of Biological Sciences at WSU includes core facilities in environmental biology, imaging and bioinformatics, an animal care facility, greenhouse, and a Biological Field Station.

Description
The Forest Growth & Yield Lab at the University of Alberta has an open graduate research assistantship at the Ph.D. level
in Applied Remote Sensing for assessment of forest resilience, under the supervision of Dr. Robert Froese. This PhD
student will address the DIVERSE project theme focused on the assessment and mapping of functional diversity and
redundancy at the national scale, using remote sensing, with the ultimate goal being the development of forest resilience
mapping. The work will combine existing forest plot and remote sensing data to assess functional diversity and resilience
and apply these findings to the landscape scape to identify traits and patterns that maximize forest resilience depending
on forest type and environmental conditions.

DIVERSE is a Pan-Canadian research initiative dedicated to advancing forest management through innovative
approaches that emphasize functional diversity and ecological connectivity. The research encompasses six
interconnected themes that aim to enhance forest resilience and sustainable forest stewardship in the face of global
changes.

The Alberta School of Forest Science and Management is located within the University of
Alberta, which is an internationally recognized research University with over 40,000
students from 156 countries. Located in Edmonton, along the North Saskatchewan River
valley and just a few hours from the Rocky Mountains, the University oﬀers a friendly and
aﬀordable environment with diverse social and outdoor recreation opportunities.

Description
Ph.D. position in Arthropod Biodiversity & Ecosystem Function 
University of Arkansas, Fayetteville  
 The Forest Ecology & Health Lab at the University of Arkansas is seeking a student interested in pursuing a Ph.D. studying arthropod biodiversity and forest ecosystem function.  The focal project will be to sample arthropods from high-elevation sites in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma, employ high-throughput DNA barcoding methods to uncover biodiversity patterns, and relate those patterns to environmental variables and ecosystem function.  Prospective applicants should have research interests in entomology, ecology, and evolutionary biology, and should have strong field, lab, and analytical skills.  Applicants with previous experience using molecular techniques (e.g., PCR, NGS library preparation, metabarcoding, etc.) and bioinformatics are preferred.  Experience with GIS and/or R is also desirable. 
 Financial support will be provided through a combination of teaching and research assistantships.  Assistantships come with a full tuition (not fees) waiver and 67% of the student health insurance paid for by the university.  The selected applicant would need to be admitted to a Ph.D. program at the University of Arkansas for the Spring 2026 semester, which begins January 12, 2026.  Students admitted to a Ph.D. program may also be eligible for a U of A Doctoral Fellowship that adds to their assistantship stipend for 4 years.  More information about these fellowships can be found at: https://graduate-students.uark.edu/cost-and-funding/index.php.  Note that applications for these fellowships require the GRE General Test even if it is not required for admission to a graduate program.  Applicants who would be competitive for a doctoral fellowship will be viewed favorably.  Continued support will be contingent on satisfactory performance and progress. 
 Research in the Forest Ecology & Health Lab uses field experiments and naturally occurring environmental gradients to examine how biogeochemistry and nutrients impact community structure and trophic interactions among soil arthropods and ant species primarily in forest ecosystems.

Description
The Integrative Wildlife Conservation lab at Trent University, Ontario, Canada, in collaboration with the Lithops Research and Conservation Foundation, is offering a unique PhD project on the eco-evolutionary and conservation dynamics of Lithops spp., a genus of small succulent plants occurring in isolated colonies across desert landscapes in southern Africa. In the wild, Lithops are susceptible to human collection, habitat loss, and climate change, with many populations and species currently subject to high extinction risk. There are important knowledge gaps related to Lithops phylogeny and ecology that are currently impacting rigorous conservation status assessment and protection. Trent University is among only a handful of facilities worldwide housing Lithops plants and seeds originating from wild colonies, providing a truly unique opportunity to address integrative questions related to evolution, population genetics, and conservation biology in a controlled, rigorous and impactful context. The PhD project may include investigations related to genome sequencing, phylogenetics, evolutionary divergence, and linkage analysis, and adaptation to harsh environmental conditions, and the candidate will have the opportunity to develop specific research questions based on their interest and expertise. 

 Successful candidates MUST have an MSc in Biology, Genetics, Conservation, or related field, demonstrated evidence of peer-reviewed publications, strong lab and field skills, and an interest in working collaboratively within a large and diverse research group. Additional desirable qualifications include DNA sequencing, bioinformatics and GIS skills.  
 To apply, send a cover letter, curriculum vitae, unofficial academic transcript, and contact information for 3 references to: Dennis Murray (dennismurray@trentu.ca). 
 For additional details, see www.dennismurray.ca and www.lithopsfoundation.com. 
 The position will be filled as soon as a suitable candidate is found.

Description
Ph.D. or M.Sc.- Graduate Assistantship in American Black Duck Movement Ecology
Department of Natural Resources Science, University of Rhode Island
 
Project title: Effects of shellfish aquaculture disturbances on American black ducks.

A graduate assistantship is available at the Ph.D. or M.Sc. level to study the spatial and movement ecology of American Black Ducks in southern New England. This project will hinge on the capture and marking of individuals with GPS transmitters and implementation of experimental shellfish aquaculture operations to determine the extent to which the presence of pseudo-aquaculture farms influences American black duck space use, energetic costs, and habitat selection behavior, and to quantify the importance of inland water sources to American black ducks responding to the presence of pseudo-aquaculture farms. We expect the results from this project to directly inform waterfowl management. This study is a continuation of a long-term effort between the university and state agency to understand the relationships between shellfish aquaculture and waterfowl ecology in Rhode Island.

Qualifications: Only hard-working, motivated, intelligent, good-natured persons interested in waterfowl ecology and movements need apply. Applicants must have completed an undergraduate degree in animal/wildlife biology or ecology, earned at least a 3.2 GPA, and must have excellent oral and written communication skills. Field experience with waterfowl capture and handling and operating boats is highly desirable. Experience with quantitative analysis and field research is required.  If applying for the PhD level assistantship, applicants who have successfully completed a relevant M.Sc. are strongly preferred and those applicants with only a BSc degree must have exceptional and relevant field experience to be considered. If applying for the M.Sc. level assistantship, applicants must have exceptional and relevant field experience to be considered. Ability to work collaboratively and to supervise research assistants and undergraduates working in the field is also required. Stipends are approx. $25,000/academic year dependent on graduate assistantship level, tuition is paid, and an additional summer stipend of approx. $18,000 is provided. Starting date is either January 2026 or September 2026.

To apply submit the following: a letter stating your qualifications and research interests, a resume or CV, unofficial college transcripts, and the names and contact information for 3 references by no later than 15 September 2025 (early application is encouraged) to:

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Southwest Research Station (PSWRS). This project is based at three long-term ecohydrological research sites (Soaproot, Newt Creek, and Providence), which are managed by the PSWRS of the USDA FS in the Sierra Nevada.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency.

Description
The Palmquist Lab at Marshall University is recruiting for a funded MS position at Marshall University in climate change and fire effects on coastal vegetation. Our research focuses on quantifying vegetation dynamics over space and time and identifying how the relative importance of ecological processes structuring plant communities changes with spatial and temporal scale. In addition, a key goal of our research is to understand how pattern and process in plant communities will be altered in the face of global environmental change. An important motivation for our work is to address ecological questions at large spatial scales to inform landscape conservation. We collect field data, use existing large observational data sets, and implement simulation modeling to address these goals in temperate shrublands, wetlands, woodlands, and forests. Additional information about the lab can be found at http://www.kylepalmquist.org/.
 RESEARCH FOCUS: The successful candidate will explore the interacting effects of sea-level rise and increased storm surge on coastal vegetation and the effects of prescribed fire on pine-dominated vegetation on Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island (MCRDPI), a sea-island in South Carolina. Coastal vegetation provides important ecosystem services, including storm protection, erosion control, and habitat for wildlife. These complex, highly zoned plant communities are structured by multiple environmental factors including salinity, elevation, soil texture, soil moisture, exposure, and light availability. Sea-level rise and intensification of the hydrologic cycle (i.e. more frequent and intense storms) is expected to affect the distribution and composition of coastal vegetation in the future, with important implications. Prescribed fire has been implemented in pine woodlands and forests on the island to enhance their resilience to climate change and to restore their structure from closed forests to open woodlands. The effects of prescribed fire have yet to be assessed. The project will integrate remote sensing, plant community sampling, and modeling to quantify how sea-level rise and associated factors have impacted coastal vegetation up to present and how climate change may influence vegetation in the future. An additional goal is to assess how prescribed fire is influencing pine-dominated vegetation on the island by installing and re-sampling permanent vegetation plots.   
 PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS: A background, including relevant course work, in botany or plant ecology, and GIS or remote sensing, strong communication skills, and strong quantitative skills. Experience in remote sensing and GIS and knowledge of the southeastern US flora is highly desirable.
 EXPECTATIONS: The successful candidate will be expected to conduct high-quality research, serve as a teaching assistant within the Department of Biological Sciences, present their research to the scientific community at regional and national meetings, and publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
 TIMELINE: The position is available starting January 2026 and possibly before.
 FUNDING: Funding will consist of a combination of research and teaching assistantships for two years. A 12-month competitive stipend ($20,000), and full tuition waiver will be provided. The student is responsible for covering University fees.
 HOW TO APPLY: Interested students should apply by submitting the following to Dr. Kyle Palmquist (palmquist@marshall.edu): 1) short statement of research interests and career goals (no longer than 1 page), 2) CV, 3) unofficial transcripts, and 4) contact information for three professional references. Please include: “MS position – coastal vegetation” and your name in the email subject.
 Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until a candidate is selected. I will contact you to discuss your research interests and goals for graduate school if I determine you would be a good fit for the lab. If selected, a full application must be submitted to the Department of Biological Sciences at Marshall University, Huntington, WV. Faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences have expertise in a variety of biological fields, including but not limited to ecology, evolution, herpetology, and physiology. More information about the Department and its programs can be found here: https://www.marshall.edu/biology/. Application requirements for admission to the DBS graduate program can be found here: https://www.marshall.edu/biology/admission/.
 Marshall University is located in Huntington, an affordable college town located on the Ohio River in the beautiful state of West Virginia. The town is small enough to get around on foot and bike, but large enough to support a variety of restaurants and other cultural activities. Huntington and the surrounding area offer ample recreational opportunities (hiking, skiing, rafting), along with proximity to larger cities, including Louisville, KY, Cincinnati, OH, and Columbus, OH. In the Palmquist Lab, we highly value and encourage work-life balance. 
 I strongly encourage students from diverse backgrounds and experiences to apply. Feel free to contact me with questions at any time.

Description
A.I.S., Inc. (AIS) is a national scientific services firm supporting maritime activities requiring certification of compliance with environmental regulations as well as collecting data for use by Federal, State, Municipal, and other government agencies along the US coastline.

AIS is looking for a Sr. Fisheries Physiologist to assist in the planning of and preparations for lab-based behavior studies with living marine resources in support of the Ecosystems and Aquaculture Division (EAD).

Primary Function:
The EAD supports research themes including the processes linking spatial and temporal patterns in climate with regional and local responses of species and their habitats. Sound originating from anthropogenic activities in the world’s oceans is increasing and so there is increased attention being paid to its ecological consequences. This is a particular concern in previously undeveloped areas of the oceans. Most of this concern has focused on the effects/impacts on marine mammal and protected species which excludes the far larger biomass and economic importance of other fish and invertebrates. Criteria and metrics employed for the use on these fishes and invertebrates have often had to be assumed and key information is lacking towards understanding disruption in such behaviors as feeding and breeding. A candidate is needed to support work towards filling these research gaps.

Duties/Responsibilities:
Leads the development and execution of advanced experimental designs, adapting as needed.
Conceives and leads large, multi-year, multi-partner research initiatives as a Co-PI and writes grant proposals, ensuring alignment with NOAA and project goals.
Supervises junior contractor staff and mentors contractor interns or volunteers.
Participates in lab experiments to collect physiological and behavioral data from fish held in research aquaria, including experience with Auditory Brainstem Response experiments using Tucker Davis Technologies System III tools and/or Loligo Systems intermittent flow respirometry equipment.
Organizes field sample collection of fish and habitat, potentially including image and genetic data.
Assists in the planning of and preparations for lab-based fish metabolism, hearing, and/or acoustic behavioral and physiological studies with living marine resources.
Calculates vital physiological rates, sound pressure, and/or particle motion stimulus intensity levels from software and/or hydrophone and geophone recordings during experiments.
Publishes research in peer-reviewed journals and co-presents at national conferences.
Builds and maintains collaborator networks to enhance project success.
 Compensation: Candidates will be paid an hourly rate to be negotiated, and total compensation will vary depending on the candidates’ depth of experience. This is a full–time position. AIS benefits package includes health and dental insurance, vacation, sick and holiday benefits. 

Minimum Qualifications:
Doctoral degree (PhD.) in Biology, Marine Science, Physiology, Neuroscience, or related fields and 5+ years of experience.
Proven experience in experimental design and statistical analysis.
Demonstrated ability to publish technical reports and peer-reviewed journal articles
Familiar with fish tagging techniques (tbar, anchor, elastomer, pit)
Basic knowledge of plumbing, valves and piping and how to connect them.
Capable and willing to do physical work in indoor/outdoor spaces, semi enclosed spaces and possible on a sea-going vessel.
Drives government vehicles (requires valid driver’s license).
Lift up to 50 lbs.
Works irregular hours, shift work, and on weekends if experiments require.

Preferred Qualifications:
Experience with spawning, husbandry, and general maintenance of marine finfish and shellfish adults and early life-stages in a captive, culture-based environment.

Travel:
Domestic and international travel may be required as follows: attendance at regional, national and international stock assessment related meetings, project-related workshops and working group meetings.

The goal is to have information on seasonal and inter-annual variability in distribution, ecology, and to estimate potential mortality or other impacts on protected species. This employee will contribute to these statutory requirements through the activities below.

Duties/Responsibilities:
Assist efforts to estimate abundance of protected species and quantify distribution trends. This includes developing spatially and temporally explicit density and abundance models and maps that incorporate environmental factors via models such as Generalized Additive Models and Bayesian Hierarchical Models. Abundance estimates must also include perception and availability bias.
Participate in efforts to develop and execute methods to address uncertainties in current analyses, such as unspecified species identification of groups of animals, species specific dive time corrections, incorporate passive acoustic data into visual abundance estimates, and compare other sampling techniques, including high-definition photogrammetry line transect aerial surveys
Build tools using R, Rshiny, and other programming interfaces
Quantify abundance, distribution, and bycatch of protected species and their physical/biological ecosystems, and estimate bycatch of protected species via observer and fishery data
As directed, use tools such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) tools, and other electronic monitoring data tools to detect, process, and describe occurrence of bycatch; and to use these tools to develop scientific algorithms that identify targeted marine animals in digital images while also documenting false negative and false negative biases
Assess and define the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities (i.e. shipping, fishing, fishing bycatch, energy development) on protected species, and the effects of potential mitigation measures to lessen these impacts
Contribute to presentations at relevant conferences and other venues, and provide support for cruise reports, permit applications, manuscripts, and presentations

Compensation: Candidates will be paid an hourly rate to be negotiated, and total compensation will vary depending on candidates’ depth of experience. This is a full–time position. AIS benefits package includes health and dental insurance, vacation, sick and holiday benefits.

Description
Law Clerk Program

Summer 2026 Law Clerkships will accept applications from July through Labor Day 2025.


About Us


Founded in 1971, Earthjustice has a distinguished track record of achieving significant, lasting environmental protections. We achieve this by hiring people who share a passion for justice and a healthy environment. We wield the power of law and the strength of partnership to protect people’s health; preserve magnificent places and wildlife; advance clean energy; and combat climate change. We partner with thousands of groups and supporters to take on the biggest, most precedent-setting cases across the country and have a distinguished track record of achieving significant, lasting environmental protections. We are here because the earth needs a good lawyer.


Earthjustice’s work is currently divided into three major areas:

Lands, Wildlife, and Oceans focuses on cases that protect endangered species, national forests, national parks, other public lands, water resources, and the oceans.
Healthy Communities focuses on cases that protect public health, prevent air and water pollution, and curb exposures to toxic chemicals, particularly in disproportionately impacted communities. Recently, our healthy communities work has also begun to promote sustainable food and agriculture and the rights of farm workers.
Climate and Energy focuses on cases that encourage the swift and just transition to clean energy while challenging the reliance on coal, oil, and other dirty fuels.

We welcome all interested law students from across the country to apply for a summer law clerk position. We expect that students will work proximate to or in an office where the program is located. In some limited instances, an office may hire clerks to work in an area that is outside that team’s geographic area, but still proximate to an Earthjustice office.


Please note the location preferences of each litigation team in their descriptions below.


Responsibilities


Summer law clerks will have the opportunity to work with several attorneys on case development and litigation strategy. Students may draft pleadings and briefs, do legal research, develop strategy and legal theories, gather evidence, and attend client meetings and court proceedings. Earthjustice’s summer law clerk program also includes various programmatic offerings, such as in-person and virtual seminars with attorneys and guest speakers on current environmental issues, interactions with other local and regional environmental groups, and a job interview workshop.


Compensation


Earthjustice summer law clerkships are paid positions. The total stipend amount will be dependent on any external funding a student secures, such as through their law school’s summer funding program. Earthjustice will provide a one-time stipend at the start of the clerkship in the amount of $1,320.00 per week, minus the total amount received from any other sources and applicable taxes. The summer law clerkship is designed to be 10 weeks long at full-time hours (37.5 hours/week).


You are welcome to pursue outside funding. The ability to secure outside funding will not be considered as part of the hiring process.


How to Apply
