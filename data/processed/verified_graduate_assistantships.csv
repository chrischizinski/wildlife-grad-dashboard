Description
The Forest Growth & Yield Lab at the University of Alberta has an open graduate research assistantship at the Ph.D. level
in Applied Remote Sensing for assessment of forest resilience, under the supervision of Dr. Robert Froese. This PhD
student will address the DIVERSE project theme focused on the assessment and mapping of functional diversity and
redundancy at the national scale, using remote sensing, with the ultimate goal being the development of forest resilience
mapping. The work will combine existing forest plot and remote sensing data to assess functional diversity and resilience
and apply these findings to the landscape scape to identify traits and patterns that maximize forest resilience depending
on forest type and environmental conditions.

DIVERSE is a Pan-Canadian research initiative dedicated to advancing forest management through innovative
approaches that emphasize functional diversity and ecological connectivity. The research encompasses six
interconnected themes that aim to enhance forest resilience and sustainable forest stewardship in the face of global
changes.

The Alberta School of Forest Science and Management is located within the University of
Alberta, which is an internationally recognized research University with over 40,000
students from 156 countries. Located in Edmonton, along the North Saskatchewan River
valley and just a few hours from the Rocky Mountains, the University oﬀers a friendly and
aﬀordable environment with diverse social and outdoor recreation opportunities.

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Southwest Research Station (PSWRS). This project is based at three long-term ecohydrological research sites (Soaproot, Newt Creek, and Providence), which are managed by the PSWRS of the USDA FS in the Sierra Nevada.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: The participant will engage in field-based research examining the impacts of wildfire and drought-induced tree mortality on water quality and quantity in headwater forest ecosystems.

The participant will collect water and gas samples from boreholes, soils, and streams, with a focus on capturing spatiotemporal variation in hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to disturbance. Specific activities will include participating in field campaigns to monitor moisture dynamics, collecting and analyzing water samples for major ions, nutrients, water stable isotopes, and carbon isotopes, and assisting in the maintenance and calibration of field instrumentation.

Laboratory activities will involve preparing and analyzing samples using techniques such as ion chromatography and isotope ratio spectroscopy. The participant will collaborate closely with graduate students and project collaborators to synthesize results, compare site responses, and contribute to research on how forest structure and climate extremes shape water availability and watershed function.

Learning Objectives: This opportunity will provide training in hydrologic instrumentation, sample analysis, and environmental data interpretation, supporting the agency’s mission to advance science-based forest and water resource management.

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is David Dralle (david.dralle@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for 3 months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $16,251.10 monthly.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.
