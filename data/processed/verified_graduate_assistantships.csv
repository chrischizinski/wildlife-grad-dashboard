 *Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment (NLAE), Agroecosystems Management Research Unit located in Ames, Iowa, on the campus of Iowa State University.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

The mission of NLAE is to address critical problems in agriculture and watershed management. Our goal is to develop innovative solutions that increase the efficiency of agriculture systems and reduce environmental risk. Transdisciplinary teams address this through coordinated research in abiotic and biotic systems.

Research Project: This project investigates carbon and nutrient cycling in soil, air, water, and crop nutrient pools within Midwestern agricultural systems. Nutrient dynamics of conventional corn-soybean production systems are being compared with those of alternative systems, such as systems that include 4R nitrogen management, cover crops and double cropping within a corn-soybean system, and organic production with extended crop rotations.

Learning Objectives: The intended outcome of this research is to improve nutrient-use efficiency in conventional Midwestern corn-soybean production systems, to increase the use of overwintering cover crops in these cropping systems, and to provide much-needed information to stakeholders practicing or considering organic production. The results will provide information to farmers, consultants, agribusiness partners, and state and federal agencies to help guide decisions on the effective use of these practices.

Under the guidance of a mentor the participant will:

be integrated within an interdisciplinary research team and develop or enhance his/her understanding of production practices that improve environmental quality and are of interest to research and policy groups addressing smart agriculture.

Description
The Wildlife Habitat Ecology Laboratory at Montana State University is seeking a motivated and collaborative Graduate Research Assistant (M.S.) to join a multidisciplinary project examining the interplay between wildfire and livestock grazing in shaping the ecological and agricultural resilience of rangelands across the Intermountain West. Shifting fire regimes, evolving land uses, and changing weather patterns are reshaping western rangelands. Fire and grazing—two historically intertwined ecological processes—jointly influence plant communities, forage productivity, soil health, and wildlife habitat. This project will evaluate how patterns of fire severity and frequency interact with grazing practices to affect soil health, vegetation composition and productivity, wildlife use, and biodiversity. Findings will inform sustainable land management strategies that balance agricultural viability with ecological integrity under rapidly changing environmental conditions.

Qualifications: 
B.S. degree in rangeland ecology, fire ecology, wildlife biology, natural resource management, or a related field.
Experience with field data collection (vegetation, soils, wildlife).
Strong quantitative and analytical skills; familiarity with GIS or remote sensing is a plus.
Ability to work independently in remote field conditions and as part of a collaborative research team.
Strong written and oral communication skills.

Application:  Submit in a single PDF file: 1) a letter of interest stating how you meet the qualifications, 2) a curriculum vitae or resume, and 3) contact information for three professional references. Submit application materials to Dr. Lance McNew, lance.mcnew@montana.edu, with subject line Graduate Research Assistant Application – Fire & Grazing Project. Applicant review will begin September 1, 2025, and continue until a suitable candidate is selected. The selected candidate will be invited to submit an official application through the Graduate School at Montana State University.

Description
Ph.D. position on multispecies use of habitat managed for Kirtland’s Warbler 
The Tonra Lab of Avian Ecology and the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center are searching for a qualified student to lead a Ph.D. research project of regional conservation importance in the School of Environment and Natural Resources at The Ohio State University. The position will preferably begin in January of 2026, but alternative start dates may be possible. 

Project Description: 
The project will study patterns of occupancy and abundance of Kirtland’s Warbler, Common Nighthawk, Eastern Whip-poor-will, Spruce Grouse, and Ruffed Grouse on sites managed for the warbler. To determine how occupancy and abundance vary with site- and landscape-level factors, we will integrate acoustic data collected via autonomous recording units and vegetation surveys from across the Kirtland’s Warbler breeding range with remote sensing data to build models that predict habitat characteristics that optimize abundance across species. Our research will produce recommendations on how best to manage and create habitat within Kirtland’s Warbler Management Areas and will also highlight where to prioritize restoration projects - all with the goal of creating optimal Kirtland’s Warbler habitat while maximizing avian species richness and recreation (i.e., hunting) opportunity. 
The Ph.D. student will be supported on a combination of Graduate Research Assistantships and Graduate Teaching Assistantships for the duration of the degree (5 years). The position includes a tuition waiver and monthly stipend (currently $2,848/month). Travel during fieldwork and other associated research costs will also be funded. 
 Required Qualifications: 
Candidates for this position must possess a minimum of a Bachelor of Science degree (Master of Science strongly preferred) in Wildlife, Biology, Zoology, or a related field. Furthermore, they must have an academic transcript commensurate with acceptance to the graduate program in Fisheries and Wildlife in the School of Environment and Natural Resources (https://senr.osu.edu/graduate/admissions). 
This project will generate a large amount of data for analysis, thus in addition to prior field work experience, we are seeking a student with excellent quantitative skills and experience with GIS. Therefore, the successful candidate will have experience working with Program R, ArcGIS or other GIS software, multiple years of experience in field ecology, the ability and willingness to work long hours independently in the field, and a valid drivers license. 
 Preferred Qualifications: 
Additional desirable qualifications include experience in programming languages in addition to R , experience working with autonomous recording units (ARUs) and associated data, experience conducting vegetation surveys, and bird identification skills. 
  To apply: 
Email a 1-page cover letter outlining your interest in and qualifications for the position, C.V., unofficial academic transcript, and contact information for 3 references to Chris Tonra (tonra.1@osu.edu).  Applications will be considered as they are received until the position is filled.

Description
Join a groundbreaking conservation research initiative developing decision support models to evaluate water management effects on the Western pond turtle, a species recently proposed for threatened status under the Endangered Species Act. This position offers the unique opportunity to conduct research with direct conservation impact while collaborating with Dr. Mike Adams and his team at the USGS Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative (ARMI), along with stakeholders from USACE and other federal and state partners.
You will lead the development of quantitative frameworks that bridge turtle ecology with water management policy in Oregon's Upper Willamette River basin. Your work will create the scientific foundation for adaptive resource management decisions affecting this sensitive species, while addressing critical knowledge gaps in turtle seasonal habitat requirements, movements, and early life history.
