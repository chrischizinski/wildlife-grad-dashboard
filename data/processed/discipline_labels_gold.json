Masters of Natural Resources program, Oregon Tech, Klamath Falls, OR\nOregon Institute of Technology (State) | https://www.oit.edu/\nDetails\nPosting:\nhttps://jherimekellermann.weebly.com/\nApplication Deadline:\n03/31/2026\nPublished:\n02/18/2026\nStarting Date:\nbetween 2/28/2026 and 9/14/2026\nEnding Date:\nbetween 6/12/2028 and 8/1/2028\nHours per Week:\n6 - 40\nSalary:\nstarting at $18 per hour\nEducation Required:\nBachelors\nExperience Required:\nat least 2 years\nLocation:\nOregon Tech (Klamath Falls, Oregon)\nTags:\nGraduate Opportunities\nDescription\nROJECT TITLE: Pinyon Jay response to juniper management, Deschutes County, Oregon.\n\nBACKGROUND: Pinyon Jays (PIJA, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) have experienced significant, range-wide declines over the past 50 years, and are currently under Status Review for ESA listing. Deschutes County, Oregon represents the northwestern-most extent of the species range and lies far outside the extant range of pinyon pine species. Extensive treatments of juniper woodlands have been expedited throughout western states for restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, sage grouse habitat, and altered fire regimes. However, we lack clear understanding of how these treatments impact PIJA populations.  \n\nManagement priorities for PIJA in Oregon include assessing impacts of juniper treatments on PIJA and determining state-wide distribution. The primary goals of this project are to experimentally study how juniper treatments impact occupancy, habitat use, and nesting of PIJA on BLM lands in Deschutes County, Oregon. We are implementing a before-after-control-impact study and use bioacoustics monitoring, point counts, and nest searching methods. The MS project will focus on at least one component of the project. This work is in partnership with the East Cascades Bird Alliance, US Fish and Wildlife, and Deschutes BLM. We also contribute to the PIJA Western Working Group and the PIJA Conservation Action Strategy (CAS). The MS candidate will be expected to coordinate with and contribute findings to larger range-wide intiatives. \n\nLOCATION & PROGRAM: This position supports a student in the Masters of Science in Natural Resources at Oregon Tech in Klamath Falls, OR. Our MS program started in 2024 and is in the Natural Sciences Department, which also encompasses the MS of Medical Science program, and BS programs in Environmental Science and Biology-Health Science. Program description and requirements are here https://www.oit.edu/academics/degrees/natural-resources \n\nSUPPORT: This position includes the opportunity for a Graduate Teaching Assistantship for the Academic Years 2026-2026 and 2027-2028. The GTA will teach labs in the 200-level Principles of Biology series for majors, &/or similar courses within the students expertise. GTAs cover two 3-hour sections per term. Oregon Tech is on a quarter system. Fall, Winter, and Spring terms are 11 weeks. Our academic year runs from mid-September to Mid-June.  The GTA provides a per-term stipend and partial tuition remission during the academic year (Fall through Spring terms). In addition, this research assistantship will provide additional part-time stipend during the spring term, and full-time hourly salary over the summer. Some travel costs from Klamath Falls to Bend, OR will be covered. The graduate student will be expected to use their own vehicle, preferably one that can handle rugged, rocky roads to access field sites. If the student would prefer to forgo the GTA position and cover their own academic costs, that would be an option. \n\nPOSITION REQUIREMENTS: The candidate should have a Bachelors degree in Natural Resources, Wildlife, Ecology, Environmental Science or a closely related program of study and should meet the requirements for acceptance into the Masters of Natural Resources program at Oregon Tech. Ideally, the applicant will have at least 2 years of field experience studying birds, particularly nest searching and point counts. Experience with bioacoustics monitoring (ARUs, BirdNET) will be especially helpful. Additionally, experience doing habitat analyses (Occupancy modeling, RSFs, SDMs) using program R and GIS will be very valuable.  The candidate should have proven ability to work independently in remote areas, and as a member of a team, including supervising undergraduates and working with volunteers. \n\n \n\nDATES: Start date is flexible. We are beginning the greater project design and implementation this winter 2026, therefore, the candidate could start as early as March, 2026 as a temporary hire. The academic year begins in mid-September, 2026. \n\nLOCATION: Oregon Tech is in Klamath Falls, OR, a small rural region of south-central Oregon. The field research about 3 hours north, near Bend and Sisters, Oregon in the east Cascades, sage-steppe biome. This region is famous for its scenic beauty, biodiversity, and outdoor recreation including hiking and trail running, mountain biking, skiing, and water sports.  \n\nAPPLICATIONS: Please email a cover letter detailing your experience, interest in the project, and career goals, along with your CV to Jherime.kellermann@oit.edu ASAP.  We will review packages as they are received.\n\nContact\nJherime Kellermann\n5418515156\njherime.kellermann@oit.edu (preferred contact method)",
