The successful applicant will begin in the Fall 2026 semester.\n\nRio Grande cutthroat trout (RGCT) are the southernmost species of cutthroat trout and have experienced a severe decline in both range and abundance, now occupying only ~12 percent of its historical distribution and requires targeted management interventions to support recovery. Major components of the recovery plan detail the need to secure extant populations and reintroduce individuals within their native range in Colorado and New Mexico. Recent efforts to date include development of a multi-source, genetically diverse broodstock for the Rio Grande basin that is used for reintroduction efforts.\n\nIndividuals from this multi-source broodstock were stocked at multiple sites throughout the recently restored Rio Costilla watershed which represents one of the largest native fish restoration projects in the country. While recent research has shown that this composite broodstock is more genetically diverse compared to using single source populations there is a need to evaluate how these fish are performing in the wild. The present project has a number of goals:\n\n          1. Evaluate genetic structure and diversity of reintroduced Rio Costilla RGCT populations\n                     a. There is also opportunity to develop questions with demographic monitoring data in this system.\n          2. Genetic assessment of Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos basins. \n                     a. Results will help inform multi-source broodstock development for Canadian & Pecos basins and identify additional source populations for Rio Grande basin.\n                     b. Results will also provide an updated genetic assessment for RGCT.\n          3. There are additional opportunities for the student to develop their own questions using genetic and demographic data.\n\nThis project is a collaborative effort funded by the New Mexico Department of Wildlife and there may be potential to collaborate with other university researchers and agencies. Benefits include a salary range of ~$28-29k/year, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance. Funding will also be available for conference travel, workshop training for data analyses, and safety training (e.g., wilderness first aid). The hired candidate will begin in Fall 2026 and will be based at NMSU in Las Cruces, NM.\n\nHow to apply: If interested, please compile the following: (1) a statement of interest that describes your educational and research background, as well as your research interests and how this position fits in your career goals (2) curriculum vitae or resume, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts compiled in a single PDF and save as ‘Lastname_RGCT_PhD.pdf’.  Applicants are also asked to upload a writing sample in the application portal. Applications should be submitted through the airtable linked here:  https://airtable.com/app3jNqbQZsYstwx7/pagrpU5GqaI6FnSTg/form \n\nApplications are due 03/18/26 by 11:59p MT. You can learn more about the Pregler Lab at https://preglerlab.com and any questions about the position can be sent to Dr. Kasey Pregler at kpregler@nmsu.edu.   \n\nQualifications: \n\nRequired: B.S. in fisheries, biology, or related field and possession of a valid U.S. driver’s license. The successful applicant must also meet the minimum requirements for admission to the NMSU Graduate School (3.0 GPA in last two years of undergrad). Applicants should also have demonstrated excellent written and oral communication skills, and an ability to work independently. \n\nPreference will be given to applicants with an M.S. degree in fisheries, biology, or related field and have experience working in the backcountry and are willing to lead field work crews in backcountry conditions.\n\nSuccessful candidates will have proficiency in R, and an interest in genetics and working with large datasets.

Our research program focuses on understanding how plants perceive and adapt to adverse environmental conditions, with the ultimate goal of protecting crops and mitigating damage caused by environmental stress.\n\nTomato will be used as the primary research model, as it is both one of the most important vegetable crops worldwide and an excellent model plant for environmental science research. Students will grow tomato plants in our greenhouse, harvest fruits at the mature green stage, and store them under different temperature conditions to investigate the effects of heat stress on fruit ripening.\n\nProject 1: Stable Carbon Isotope Fractionation and Fruit Respiration\nOne student will focus on developing a novel approach using stable carbon isotope fractionation to monitor the effects of heat stress on fruit respiration pathways, which are closely linked to fruit productivity. Although stable isotope fractionation is widely used in geochemistry, it has rarely been applied to the study of fruit ripening. This approach will provide a multidimensional perspective on how heat stress influences fruit respiratory metabolism. This project includes a collaboration with Rice University, where the student will spend approximately one week each year conducting specialized isotope measurements.\n\nProject 2: Role of Abscisic Acid (ABA) in Heat Stress Tolerance\nThe second student will investigate the role of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) in tomato plant development and fruit ripening, with a particular focus on its involvement in heat stress responses and resistance mechanisms. This project will compare wild-type tomatoes with mutant lines that have reduced or enhanced ABA accumulation in fruits, with the goal of understanding how ABA influences fruit survival under heat stress conditions.\n\nThrough two years of research training, students will gain a strong foundation in the concepts and techniques of environmental stress research, develop proficiency with relevant laboratory and greenhouse instrumentation, and acquire skills essential for careers in environmental science research, agricultural chemistry, and environmental monitoring.\n\nFunding and Qualifications\nProspective students with an interest in agricultural chemistry are encouraged to apply. Students will be supported as teaching assistants, receiving a $15,000 annual stipend and $7,000 in tuition remission, distributed equally across the three academic terms.\n\nApplicants should have a bachelor’s degree in chemistry, biology, agriculture, environmental science, or a related discipline, along with strong written and verbal communication skills and the ability to work both independently and as part of a research team.\n\nApplication Process\nApplications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, with the position closing on March 31, 2026.

Hares have been studied for >40 years on-site, and this new work will investigate the role of food and vegetative structure on hare behavioural repertoires in the context of their 10-year population cycles. Hares live on a fine edge between risk of predation/starvation vs. sustainable nutrition, setting the stage for critical behavioural tradeoffs though space and time. Using archived as well as new GPS telemetry and accelerometry data, combined with assays of structural cover and food availability/quality from remote sensing, the project will address some of the following questions: 1) Whether hares adjust movements and feeding behaviours in response to variation in food and cover, and 2) If hare responses are fine-tuned according to cyclic population dynamics and corresponding variation in predation risk and conspecific density. It is uncertain how hares survive on low-quality woody browse and limited shrub cover during winter, setting the stage for using hyperspectral imaging and LiDAR to help develop: 3) Maps of hare nutritional/structural cover landscapes through space and time, and 4) Relating hare behaviours to these complex, variable environments. Additional remote sensing using ground penetrating radar (GPR) can further support these efforts by: 5) Addressing the role of local snow conditions (depth, hardness) on food/cover availability, and corresponding hare responses through the winter season. Data resulting from such research could support dynamic models exploring how hares respond to environmental variation under climate change. The PhD student will have the opportunity to develop specific research questions within the scope of the larger project.\n\nThe successful applicant MUST have an MSc in Ecology, Conservation Biology, or related field, demonstrated evidence of peer-reviewed publications, strong field and quantitative skills, and an interest in working collaboratively within a large and diverse research group.

For decades our team studied vertebrates in the boreal forest ecosystem in the region, and we are now extending this  work to address pressing questions related to vegetation and snow dynamics in this rapidly-changing northern landscape. Using an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with LiDAR, multispectral, and RGB sensors, and combined with archived satellite data for the region, the PhD student may investigate some of the following questions: 1) Patterns of forest productivity, regeneration, and phenology across space and time, and 2) Sources of forest structural heterogeneity and resilience to insect outbreaks or fire. A high priority is to understand how the boreal forest may be impacted by climate change, which can be accomplished by: 3) Combining and back-casting remote sensing products to predict past changes to forest structural cover and deciduous vegetation composition (shrubification). Likewise, we are interested in understanding how variable snow conditions may affect winter forest dynamics and ecology of terrestrial mammals by: 4) Using ground penetrating radar and LiDAR to identify the determinants of local snow conditions (hardness, density). Ultimately, these investigations can lead to: 5) Forecasts of future boreal forest and snow dynamics under IPCC climate change scenarios.

Gerber (https://bgerber123.github.io/) at the Colorado Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and wildlife researchers at Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The graduate research assistantship will cover university tuition, fees, health coverage, and includes a pre-tax monthly pay of $3000/month. The position is expected to start Fall 2026 and be funded through December 2028.\n\nStudy Context: Sex and age class are important demographic parameters used in population modeling, in which the results help guide management decisions and annual harvest quotas of large mammals (e.g., elk, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, mule deer). This work will help develop new methodology and workflows that will aid Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s objective of producing robust empirical demographic data and population estimates for harvested wildlife. \n\nFocus: The focus of this study will be to collect data on the size distribution of elk sex and age classes (cow, calf, bull) to train and test a predictive approach using AI algorithms (developed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife) to classify animals from high-resolution aerial imagery. Field observations and size measurements (via 3D camera) will be collected to help test the accuracy of AI predictions. An additional avenue of exploration may be data collection and AI classification of sex/age class from camera trap images. The student will be expected to develop a project proposal outlining study objectives in coordination with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and a graduate committee at Colorado State University. The student will focus on technological and software workflows to meet study objectives, however, there will likely be field work opportunities as well (e.g., field observations, drone/aerial surveys). Given the trajectory of the wildlife field, the skills gained in this study will likely be desirable for future employers. \n\n Preferred Qualifications: \n\n-          Ungulate field research experience in the intermountain west\n-          Clear interest or experience developing data analysis workflows\n-          Clear interest or experience advancing technological innovation (hardware/software) in wildlife science\n-          Experience deploying camera traps and managing large data sets\n-          Experience with AI algorithms, for example MegaDetector or SpeciesNet\n \nMinimum Qualifications:\n-          A Bachelor of Science degree in wildlife ecology, biology, natural resource management, or related field\n-          A year or more of wildlife related professional research/work experience\n-          Strong writing skills\n-          Strong work ethic \n-          Desire to collaborate with state wildlife management agencies\n\nTo be considered, please send the following materials via email with “AI/Elk Application” as the subject line to Dr. Brian D. Gerber (brian.gerber@colostate.edu) by March 2, 2026: 1) Cover letter outlining career goals, academic interests, and relevant experience related to the minimum and preferred qualifications, 2) resume with contact information for 3-4 personal references, and unofficial copy of B.S. transcripts. \n\nContact\nBrian D.

Opportunity: Riparian restoration tools in working grasslands\nThe Genomics, Ecology, and Modeling for Conservation Lab at North Dakota State University, led by Travis Seaborn, is recruiting for one M.S. position to join our team working on a recently funded project in collaboration with the Albert K. Ekre Grassland Preserve. For more information on the preserve see: https://ndsufoundation.com/magazine/2021/09/ekre-grassland-preserve. \n Anticipated start date: Summer 2026. Stiped ~$25,000 for 2-3 years. Tuition waiver also provided.\n The overall project will advance our ability to understand community responses to riparian restoration. Riparian ecosystems in the Northern Great Plains have been heavily altered by anthropogenic activities. Although there are numerous restoration options for riparian ecosystems, a common and effective restoration practice, in particular in incised stream systems, are beaver dam analogs. Using streams at the Ekre Grassland Preserve and nearby public land, we will be looking to do a restoration project using invasive buckthorn woody materials. To achieve this, we are beginning to plan a Before-After-Control-Impact design to assess riparian and floodplain ecosystem responses, including geomorphology, biological community, and water quality. Much of the beaver dam analog research that has been done has occurred in the western United States, and response to these activities in the Northern Great Plains is unknown. Surveys of the biological community may include electrofishing and minnow trapping for fish, camera traps for mammals, visual and auditory surveys for birds, and plant identification along transects.\n The primary goals of this position include:\n1.    Identify the impact of beaver dam analogs.\n2.    Using geographic information systems, develop beaver species distribution models for the region.\n To apply: Please email travis.seaborn@ndsu.edu a letter of interest, which should include an explanation of fit and past relevant experience, and CV by February 20th.\nContact\nTravis Seaborn\n2537973130\ntravis.seaborn@ndsu.edu (preferred contact method)",

ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: Aspergillus flavus, a common pathogen of maize globally, is especially problematic in the southeastern region of the United States. It causes ear-rot and contaminates grain with aflatoxin, a highly carcinogenic mycotoxin.

The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: The US National Poultry Research Center (USNPRC) is seeking a postdoctoral fellow to investigate the complex molecular interactions between Infectious Laryngotracheitis Virus (ILTV) and the host immune system. As an alphaherpesvirus, ILTV causes significant economic losses worldwide through respiratory distress and decreased production in poultry. This research specifically focuses on the characterization of virus-encoded immunoregulatory proteins, known as virokines, which serve as evolved mechanisms allowing the virus to subvert or evade the host’s innate and adaptive immune responses. By utilizing synthetic biology and reverse genetics, the participant will dissect the function of these proteins to identify targets for attenuation, ultimately leveraging these insights to engineer next-generation vaccine candidates using viral-vector platforms to bridge the gap between fundamental virology and applied veterinary medicine.\n\nResearch activities will include the characterization of novel ILTV-encoded virokines to determine their specific cellular targets within the avian immune system and develop novel vaccines. The fellow will determine the role of these immunomodulatory proteins in viral replication and pathogenesis using both in vitro and in vivo models.

The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: Many crop species have relatives that have also been domesticated, with selection independently being applied in the various species to modify traits such as seed size, dormancy, reduction of seed dispersal, changes in taste or toxic compounds, or changes in photoperiod sensitivity or plant architecture. Within the legume family, more than two dozen species have been domesticated, including plants such as pea, soybean, peanut, and common bean. The many related but independently domesticated species offer an opportunity to determine in which cases the domestications have occurred through modification of genetically corresponding (orthologous) genes, or via distinct, non-corresponding loci. This project will use a combination of analyses utilizing gene families, synteny relationships, genetic association results, and published gene functional information, to catalog and evaluate the genes involved in domestication in crops within the legume plant family. This research has applied value, through identification of genes that are likely to modify important domestication-related traits across many species. The research also addresses basic questions, such as whether domestication has preferentially operated on genes that have unusually high amounts of standing variation within wild populations.\n\nUnder the guidance of a mentor, this opportunity will involve: developing and applying methods in computational biology and artificial intelligence to gather information about gene function in the legume family; using the results to identify gene correspondences at several taxonomic levels – in particular, across genera, typically spanning several species of agronomic importance such as beans or chickpeas and also across the plant family as a whole; and to identify correspondences among agronomically important genes across many crop and model species in this large plant family. After identifying corresponding genes, genomic regions will be evaluated for features such as signatures of selection or diversifying or purifying selection, around genes and regions of agricultural importance.\n\nLearning Objectives: The participant will learn and apply methods in computational biology, genetics, and artificial intelligence, including statistical methods of marker-trait association, methods for determining syntenic relationships and for calculating and representing pan-genome relationships, methods for inferring gene families, and methods for inferring evolutionary events from large collections of gene families. The participant will also have the opportunity to read, evaluate, and participate in writing scientific manuscripts in these areas of focus.\n\nMentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Steven Cannon (Steven.Cannon@usda.gov).

ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nThe mission of the Tropical Crop and Commodity Protection Research Unit in Hilo, Hawaii is to develop pre and postharvest technologies and management strategies for invasive pests, and to open and maintain market access and improved quality of tropical fruit, vegetable and ornamental crops grown in the Pacific Basin. The long-term goals of our research program are to develop and protect U.S export markets for fresh tropical commodities. An emphasis is placed on expanding and diversifying agriculture and agricultural exports in Hawaii and other states by providing environmentally sound, economically viable systems, treatments, or processes that control quarantine pests, ensure product quality, and increase product value while safeguarding the agriculture of other states.\n\nResearch Project: ‘Ulu (breadfruit) has significant cultural importance to Hawaiians and is one of the original staple crops that fed the island nation for close to 1,000 years with high starch, fiber, and protein contents. ‘Ulu also has a low to moderate glycemic index when cooked and can help manage blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Today, at nearly 2,500 miles from the US mainland, Hawaii imports greater than 85% of its food. Disruption to the supply chain can have catastrophic effects as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2020, food insecurity has dramatically increased among the Islands, encouraging the expansion of stable crops and processing capabilities that support the long-term storage and distribution of processed foods derived from these staple foods.\n\nMuch of Hawaii ‘ulu supply is sold as fresh produce. Mature ‘ulu, once picked, becomes soft within 1-3 days without refrigeration; the short shelf-life reduces profit margins, generates waste, limits its distribution and export opportunities. The ‘Ulu Cooperative, a collection of small, diversified ‘ulu producers, helped develop processes to produce ‘ulu flour in 2011 to increase its potential market and maximize the yield of ‘ulu. One of the biggest hurdles, however, to the processing of many of Hawaii’s crops is the lack of industrial scale facilities. With Hawaii having the highest electricity retail price at more than double the US average, the cost of large-scale processing is prohibitive. Presently, processing of ‘ulu relies on steamers and dehydrators, which are time consuming and do not produce the most consistent quality of end products. Improved processing methods are urgently needed to overcome the bottleneck of scaling up ‘ulu production, increase market distribution, reduce waste, and foster local economies. Specific activities will include maintaining and operating food processing equipment, experimental design, and nutritional and sensory analysis. Outcomes from this project will be useful to our 'ulu growers as well as other tropical commodities that are extremely perishable and in need of better processing methods.\n\nLearning Objectives: The participant will learn how to incorporate their scientific and technical knowledge in the field of food science with food processing engineering to improve the processing capability for both research within ARS and the stakeholders in Hawaii. The participant will get to explore the possibility of incorporating sensors, spectroscopy, imaging, and machine learning techniques into the postharvest processing workflows and/or pre-harvest evaluation of food quality and safety. The participant will have the opportunity to interact with our commercial and academic collaborators, and present their research to a wide range of audiences in engineering and food science disciplines.\n\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Peishih Liang (peishih.liang@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: 2026.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full-time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. \n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS.

ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: A key objective of the Circular Economy for Reimagining Maize Agriculture (CERCA) project supported by USDA-ARS is to develop corn varieties with reduced grain protein content coupled with high yield. This will help US farmers continue to produce corn grain efficiently for animal feed and industrial uses while reducing input costs associated with nitrogen fertilizer. Rather than extracting nitrogen from soil in the form of grain, a new approach to corn agriculture is to recycle nitrogen on-farm as much as possible to improve its profitability and sustainability. One strategy to achieve this goal is to reduce fertilizer inputs and select for new varieties that primarily remobilize nitrogen from senescing leaves to roots, stalks, or cobs rather than seeds.\n\nThe participant will help evaluate three generations of selection for reduced grain protein content that were performed independently at three locations (IA, MN, and MO) and in three populations by CERCA collaborators. In 2026 samples of the three starting populations, the most recent selected generations from each location, and control unselected generations will be planted in NC and in other CERCA cooperator locations. The participant will be involved in field experiments and controlled pollinations to produce research materials. The participant will measure grain protein content on 96 individual plants within each sub-population using near-infrared reflectance spectrophotometry. Grain protein content data of each population will be compared to measure the effectiveness of individual plant selection to reduce grain protein content.\n\nThe participant will also perform low coverage sequencing of each plant and manage bioinformatics pipelines for genomic data analysis.  Protein content data will be combined with genotype data to permit two tests of functional importance of each genetic variant: genome-wide association study and signals of selection due to allele frequency shifts under selection. Candidate genes identified by these approaches will be evaluated for involvement in biosynthesis and cellular localization of storage proteins. Genes identified in this way will represent targets for future gene editing to improve the rate of genetic improvement for reduced grain protein content. \n\nLearning Objectives: The candidate will learn about genetic analysis of complex phenotypes in crops and the use of genetics to understand and manipulate grain protein content. The candidate will collaborate with the USDA ARS CERCA team. The candidate will gain experience by participating in CERCA meetings as well as ARS unit meetings.\n\nMentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is James Holland (jim.holland@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: July 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $73,944 - $82,357 annually.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS.

The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: This appointment is part of the Methods and Applications of Food Composition Laboratory effort improve the speed, accuracy, and/or sensitivity of methods for measuring nutrients in the foods Americans eat. Dietary fiber (DF) is the polymeric carbohydrate portion of plant-based foods not hydrolyzed by human digestive enzymes.  DF consumption has been linked to reduced plasma cholesterol concentration, improved glucose regulation, and decreased incidence of heart disease and colorectal cancer. Since 2005 the Dietary Guidelines for Americans have listed underconsumption of DF as a public health concern, however changes the definition of DF have resulted in a complicated and costly process for measuring DF content in foods. The goal of this project is to reduce the cost of dietary fiber analysis. The development of a simplified method for DF determination and adoption by professional organizations such as the AOAC or Cereals & Grains (formerly AACC) would benefit\n\nThe fellow will learn how to generate an instrumental method for soluble dietary fiber analysis, along with exemplar data sufficient to initiate an interlaboratory study, which is required for AOAC and AACC approval.  Samples of beans (Great Northern and black), cereal grains (whole wheat and rice), ancient grains (sorghum and spelt), pseudocereals (amaranth and buckwheat), and traditional foods with novel carbohydrate components such as algae (nori and kombu) will be commercially obtained.  Lyophilized, ground, food samples will be digested and under the biomimetic conditions of AOAC 2022.01 in tared digestion tubes, however after digestion, IDF will be isolated by centrifugation.  Bypassing precipitation, proteinaceous and mineral components will be removed from the supernatant using ion exchange resins. The supernatant will be lyophilized and reconstituted at several levels of dilution to optimize method selectivity and sensitivity. Each level will receive the internal standard, diethyleneglycol, and be analyzed by size exclusion chromatography followed by RI detection and universal mass calibration will be performed by viscometry.    As a universal detector, RI allows for absolute quantitation of soluble dietary fiber with no need for ash or nitrogen correction, saving time and reducing cost. Universal mass calibration will offer true molecular weight data for soluble fiber composition.  These data will be published in an AOAC or AACC journal, and a potential interlaboratory study.\n\nLearning Objectives: As a result of this training, the participant will gain knowledge and experience in:\n\nEnzymatic, chromatographic and related methods for the analysis of dietary fiber and other carbohydrates.\nAnalytical method validation, including assessment of analytical figures of merit, robustness, and method detection limits.\nStatistical methods used to evaluate assay variability in nutrition science.\nMentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Michael Bukowski (michael.bukowski@usda.gov).

Deschutes County, Oregon represents the northwestern-most extent of the species range and lies far outside the extant range of pinyon pine species. Extensive treatments of juniper woodlands have been expedited throughout western states for restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, sage grouse habitat, and altered fire regimes. However, we lack clear understanding of how these treatments impact PIJA populations.  \n\nManagement priorities for PIJA in Oregon include assessing impacts of juniper treatments on PIJA and determining state-wide distribution. The primary goals of this project are to experimentally study how juniper treatments impact occupancy, habitat use, and nesting of PIJA on BLM lands in Deschutes County, Oregon. We are implementing a before-after-control-impact study and use bioacoustics monitoring, point counts, and nest searching methods. The MS project will focus on at least one component of the project. This work is in partnership with the East Cascades Bird Alliance, US Fish and Wildlife, and Deschutes BLM. We also contribute to the PIJA Western Working Group and the PIJA Conservation Action Strategy (CAS).

Specific aspects of the study will include the construction of a user-friendly, ArcGIS online decision support tool for prioritizing areas for reforestation that will maximize co-benefits for waterfowl. The position carries an annual stipend of $20,000 plus tuition waiver. Expected start date of May or August 2026. \n Project Description: Bottomland hardwood forests are under extreme and accelerated pressure from anthropogenic and environmental stressors, subsequently impact many ecological processes including the degradation of habitat quality for forested wetland dependent waterfowl. The extent of historical loss from drainage and agricultural conversion; degradation of forest health from insects and disease; shifts in tree species composition from water stress, and excessive declines in abundance of wintering waterfowl in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley are overwhelmingly documented. Thus, restoration and reforestation effects are of utmost priority in the region and newly emerging carbon credit markets may provide the catalyst needed to accelerate reforestation in the region to improve habitat suitability for wintering mallards. The purpose of this project is to provide guidance for carbon-based reforestation efforts to maximize the co-benefits for waterfowl.   \n Requirements: Applicants must have a 2.7 overall undergraduate GPA or 3.0 GPA in the last 60 semester hours of undergraduate courses.

Projects within this research unit are generally aimed at solving questions related to the biology of plant pathogens and cover a range of applied and fundamental research topics. The research opportunities for this postdoc will be centered around investigating a new source of genetic disease resistance in potatoes. This resistance trait was identified and mapped in Solanum microdontum (Mcd) by its ability to protect tubers from bacterial soft rot disease.  There are three important questions that need to be addressed to prepare the germplasm for use in applied breeding programs:\n\nDoes Mcd resistance provide protection from other potato pathogens;\nDoes Mcd resistance provide protection to stems, leaves, and other tissues;\nWhat genes are responsible for Mcd resistance. \nFor additional background about this project see: doi: 10.1094/PHYTO-05-23-0158-R and doi: 10.1007/s12230-021-09859-8.  \n\nLearning Objectives: The postdoc will have the opportunity to learn advanced bacterial molecular genetics, biochemistry, next-generation sequencing methods and functional genomics, fluorescence microscopy, plant pathology, molecular plant-microbe interactions, and other skills related to developing an independent research program.

The research will take place in a USDA-ARS lab located in the Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology Section of Cornell University’s School of Integrative Plant Science, providing a dynamic and inspiring environment with a range of programs to support their professional development.\n\nMentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Bryan Swingle (bryan.swingle@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $73,000 annually.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.

ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nhttps://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/ithaca-ny/robert-w-holley-center-for-agriculture-health/emerging-pests-and-pathogens-research/\n\nResearch Project: The Emerging Pests and Pathogens Research Unit (EPPRU) is seeking a motivated Post Doctoral fellow to participate in a multi-disciplinary research program focused on the molecular biology of plant pathogenic bacteria. Projects within this research unit are generally aimed at solving questions related to the biology of plant pathogens and cover a range of applied and fundamental research topics. The research opportunities for this postdoc will be centered around investigating a new source of genetic disease resistance in potatoes. This resistance trait was identified and mapped in Solanum microdontum (Mcd) by its ability to protect tubers from bacterial soft rot disease.  There are three important questions that need to be addressed to prepare the germplasm for use in applied breeding programs:\n\nDoes Mcd resistance provide protection from other potato pathogens;\nDoes Mcd resistance provide protection to stems, leaves, and other tissues;\nWhat genes are responsible for Mcd resistance. \nFor additional background about this project see: doi: 10.1094/PHYTO-05-23-0158-R and doi: 10.1007/s12230-021-09859-8.  \n\nLearning Objectives: The postdoc will have the opportunity to learn advanced bacterial molecular genetics, biochemistry, next-generation sequencing methods and functional genomics, fluorescence microscopy, plant pathology, molecular plant-microbe interactions, and other skills related to developing an independent research program. The postdoc will be encouraged to attend professional conferences to present research results, participate in grant writing, and contribute to writing manuscripts. The research will take place in a USDA-ARS lab located in the Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology Section of Cornell University’s School of Integrative Plant Science, providing a dynamic and inspiring environment with a range of programs to support their professional development.\n\nMentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Bryan Swingle (bryan.swingle@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $73,000 annually.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\n\nQuestions: Please visit our Program Website.

The PARM position has administrative (25%), research (45%), teaching and mentoring (25%), and service (5%) responsibilities, and will be responsible for supporting aquaculture initiatives that address university and MDNR interests. The core appointment is based on a 9-month academic contract. However, due to the year-round needs of the hatchery and the PARM program, the position includes additional expectations during the winter and summer terms, and these will be compensated by an additional stipend.\nAdministrative responsibilities include, but are not limited to, providing vision for and year-round oversight of CFRE Fish Hatchery operations, developing and managing the hatchery operational budget, supervising hatchery personnel, and working with internal and external partners to ensure smooth operation of the hatchery. Research responsibilities include creating an active, externally-funded research program in aquaculture that engages students and supports LSSU and MDNR research needs, publishing research results in peer-reviewed scientific journals, presenting at professional conferences, acquiring external funding for research, and maintaining and developing collaborative relationships with state, federal, and tribal agencies. Teaching responsibilities may include teaching Freshwater Fish Culture, Internship in Aquaculture, Apprenticeship in Fish Culture, and thesis mentoring (Senior Project and MS Project). Mentoring undergraduates and graduate students engaged in research is expected.\nLSSU is a small (<2,000 undergraduate students) state university located in the beautiful Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Additionally, LSSU is surrounded by three Great Lakes and many state, provincial, and national forests and parks that provide tremendous recreational opportunities and a high quality of life.\nThe CFRE Fish Hatchery (https://www.lssu.edu/cfre/undergraduate-opportunities/hatchery/) houses a student-run Atlantic salmon hatchery, providing hands-on classroom opportunities. The Richard and Theresa Barch CFRE building, located adjacent to the hatchery, provides expanded research facilities, including an analytical lab and experimental mesocosms, along with a Great Lakes Discovery Center for K-12 education, all along the shores of the St. Marys River. The facility is uniquely positioned to build partnerships to advance Great Lakes education, research, and community engagement in the region. The Assistant Professor of Aquaculture position will play a key role in contributing to the growth of the CFRE and related student opportunities.\nSuccess of students within the School of Natural Resources (SNR) stems from extensive interaction with faculty during hands-on labs, student research, and active student organizations. All students within the school are required to complete senior thesis research and they are encouraged to present their research at regional and national scientific conferences. Additionally, the SNR recently created an accelerated MS (4+1) program in Fisheries and Wildlife, which enables expanded research opportunities.

This is a full-time appointment for one year with anticipated renewal for a second year, contingent on funding and job performance.\n\nThe postdoctoral researcher will play a leading role in analyzing an extensive acoustic dataset of migratory birds in western North America. The project integrates bioacoustic monitoring, machine learning-based species classification, landscape ecology, and weather and radar data to address fundamental and applied questions about bird migration. The position offers opportunities to lead multiple peer-reviewed publications and to collaborate with researchers at UIUC, MPG Ranch, and partner institutions. The postdoctoral researcher will be primarily supervised by Dr. Benjamin Van Doren, Assistant Professor in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences (https://www.migrationbiology.org/).\n\nResearch Focus\n\nThis research will apply recent advances in AI-enabled bioacoustic analysis to a multi-year archive of passive acoustic recordings collected across a network of sites in the Intermountain West. The postdoctoral researcher will contribute to research aims that will include (1) landscape influences on migratory habitat use and (2) environmental drivers of migration decision-making. There may also be opportunities to pursue project extensions, such as incorporating additional acoustic datasets, modeling fine-scale migration flows, examining social dynamics of migrants, analyzing regional variation in vocalizations, or linking bioacoustic data with large-scale monitoring programs.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nLead quantitative analyses of large-scale bioacoustic, environmental, and landscape datasets\nIntegrate acoustic data with radar, weather, and remote-sensing products\nDevelop and publish peer-reviewed manuscripts (expected 3–4 papers over the appointment)\nContribute to project coordination with research partners\nMentor graduate and undergraduate students \nPresent findings at scientific conferences and workshops\n\nRequired Qualifications\n\nPh.D. in Ecology, Wildlife Biology, Conservation Biology, Computational Biology, or a related field \nStrong quantitative and analytical skills\nExperience working with large ecological datasets\nProficiency in R and/or Python for data analysis\nDemonstrated ability to lead scientific publications\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\nExperience with bioacoustics, passive acoustic monitoring, or automated species classification\nFamiliarity with bird migration ecology\nExperience integrating ecological data with weather, radar, or remote-sensing data\nBackground in spatial or landscape ecology\nInterest in applied conservation questions\n\nSalary and Benefits\n\nThe anticipated salary range is $55,000–$60,000, commensurate with experience. The position includes a comprehensive benefits package.\n\nRemote Work Policy\n\nCandidates able to work in person at UIUC will be preferred, but hybrid and remote work arrangements may be considered. \n\nUniversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign\n\nUIUC is a leading public research university with a strong tradition of interdisciplinary scholarship. The campus hosts world-class programs in ecology, evolutionary biology, natural resources, computer science, and data science, providing a rich intellectual environment for collaborative research. Champaign-Urbana offers a high quality of life, a low cost of living, and a vibrant academic community.\n\nApplication Instructions\n\nApplicants should submit the following documents to the form located at https://forms.gle/XV23vBEDHiRoH1Ei9.\n\nA cover letter describing research interests, relevant experience, and interest in this position\nA curriculum vitae (CV)\nContact information for 3 references\n\nReview of applications will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled.
