    "description": "PhD Position: Ecology of Alpine Birds in the Alps\nTexas A&M University (State)\nDetails\nApplication Deadline:\n09/07/2025\nPublished:\n08/18/2025\nStarting Date:\nafter 1/1/2026\nHours per Week:\nat least 40\nSalary:\nCommensurate / Negotiable\nEducation Required:\nMasters\nExperience Required:\nat least 2 years\nLocations:\nCollege Station, Texas\nBern, Switzerland\nTags:\nGraduate Opportunities\nDescription\nMountain ecosystems are among the regions most susceptible to temperature warming, and species adapted to alpine ecosystems are predicted to face local extinctions via physiological and/or behavioral intolerance to rapid increases in temperature. Persistence of alpine avifauna will depend upon the ability of individuals to seek out microhabitats that provide cool refugia while engaging in behaviors that reduce energy expenditure. Identifying such microclimate refugia and understanding how alpine birds use them will help inform management strategies for conserving alpine ecosystems in the face of rapid temperature warming. This funded PhD project focuses on two focal species, Rock Ptarmigan and Rock Partridge, using state-of-the-art GPS tracking technology to quantify fine-scale movement patterns, as well as climate monitoring at study sites and land surface temperature mapping using a thermal drone. The project is located in the Swiss Alps and has completed two field seasons, with fieldwork projected to continue for an additional 1-2 years. \n\nThe successful PhD Candidate will have access to the full study data set, with the opportunity to develop new field and/or analytical components depending upon logistics, expertise and interest. The Candidate must hold a MSc degree in biology or equivalent and ideally will show a strong interest in conservation science, environmental management and spatial analyses. \n\nAdditional preferred (but not required) skills include: field experience studying birds or other vertebrates in montane landscapes, strong quantitative background with ability and interest to rapidly gain new skillsets related to the joint analysis of animal movement, climate, and remote sensing data, and knowledge of French and/or German. \n\nThe project will be co-advised as a collaboration between Prof. Dr. Raphaël Arlettaz at University of Bern Division of Conservation Biology (Switzerland) and Assistant Professor Dr. Ian Ausprey at Texas A&M University Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology (USA). The Candidate will spend the first year at Uni Bern and the second two years at Texas A&M University and must be willing and able to commit to this schedule (exact timing negotiable). The PhD will be defended and granted at Uni Bern. \n\nStart: January 2026. Duration: 3 years, with possible prolongation. Salary according to SNSF rules. \n\nApplications must be submitted to ian.ausprey@ag.tamu.edu and should include a motivation letter describing your interests, experience and relevance for this position, a CV (including a list of publications if available), abstract of MSc thesis, and contact information for three professional references (institution, email, and phone number).\n\nThe application deadline is September 7th, 2025, with online interviews during the second half of September 2025.\n\nContact\nDr. Ian Ausprey\nian.ausprey@ag.tamu.edu (preferred contact method)",
