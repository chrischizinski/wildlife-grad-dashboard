The project will work with the Ashley Rakahuri Recovery Group, a community conservation organisation that undertakes bird surveys and predator control on the river. We anticipate a project that builds on the strong work of this group to answer questions related to understanding the optimal interventions that community groups can take to increase populations of endemic braided river birds. There is some scope for the student to develop their own research questions within this broader research focus. \n The student will be be enrolled in Te Kura Pūtaiao Koiora |The School of Biological Sciences at Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury (UC) in Christchurch. Tenure is for three years, and is entirely research-focused, with no required coursework. The scholarship provides a tax-free stipend of $32,650 per year and also covers all tuition fees, for three years. \n Project Background \nBraided rivers in New Zealand are breeding sites for a range of endemic birds, some of which are declining. The Ashley River/Rakahuri is a smaller braided river which has several rare or declining species (including black fronted tern and wrybill). It is close to Christchurch, and has a community group ARRG (Ashley Rakahuri Recovery Group) which has been doing pest control and nest monitoring since 2004. However, while the trapping effort has increased, bird nest success on the Ashley has declined. \n The overall aim is to determine the most successful interventions for the conservation of braided river birds in the Ashley River/Rakahuri. \nResearch questions that could be addressed by this PhD include: \nWhat are the key factors determining nest success in selected bird species (including flooding, riverbed island dynamics, weed control, exotic mammalian predators, and native bird predators)?\nHow effectively can numbers of key pests be reduced (trap types, numbers and locations, use of dogs etc)?\nIs the balance of predator species changing and is that affected by pest control?\nWhat is the most effective method for nest monitoring?\nHow important is reproduction (relative to adult survival) in bird population trends?\n\n\nThe exact focus of the PhD would depend on the skills and interests of the selected student who will work with our supervisory team and ARRG representatives to develop research objectives that best complement the student’s interests, previous experiences, and aspirations.\n\nWho you are\n\nWe are looking for a confident, independent, capable, and motivated student with a strong interest in avian conservation. We seek someone curious, enthusiastic, and eager to contribute to innovative research. You should be able to engage productively with external parties - such as community groups - and have strong communication skills. You should have experience working independently in the field, ideally with experience monitoring birds and/or with vertebrate pest control. A good grounding in ecological statistics is highly desirable. Additional skills, such as GIS, mist-netting, nest monitoring, and/or handling of wild birds would be advantageous but are not essential.\n\nThese characteristics will be demonstrated by your previous research experience, training, interests and other activities, and underpinned by either a Masters degree or a Bachelors degree with Honours (a 4-year degree with a senior thesis may satisfy this), in ecology or a related field. The ideal candidate will have had some research experience (demonstrated by associated outputs like a publication or thesis). We particularly welcome applications from individuals from under-represented groups.\n\nA valid New Zealand driver’s license and ability to drive safely in New Zealand conditions (a mix of urban and country roads) will be required.\n\nApplicants must meet the eligibility requirements of the University of Canterbury, and must be available to begin study by March 2026.\n\nTo apply, please provide:\n\n1. A cover letter that outlines your motivation, interests and experience.\n\n2. A curriculum vitae and copies of your academic transcripts (unofficial copies are fine at this stage).\n\n3. Contact information for two referees able to comment on your academic and other achievements.\n\nApplications should be emailed as a single pdf file with your name in the file name to Sara Kross (sara.kross@canterbury.ac.nz) with “PhD Scholarship on braided river birds” in the subject line. The position is open until filled, but we recommend submitting applications by 15 October for full consideration.

Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: The Hawaii Permanent Plot Network, known as HIPPNET (www.hippnet.hawaii.edu), is a long-term ecosystem and climate monitoring project, conducting vegetation remeasurements every 5 years for monitoring ecosystem plots on Hawaii Island's windward (wet) and leeward (dry) sides. The HIPPNET forest monitoring plots are part of the Smithsonian Institution’s global forest monitoring network known as the Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO, https://forestgeo.si.edu/). The standardized protocols utilized in the HIPPNET project were developed by the Smithsonian’s Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) and are the same as those used by the ForestGEO sites around the world. The HIPPNET plots provide a natural outdoor classroom for hands-on training in these global forest monitoring field techniques utilized in ForestGEO and the computer software and hardware technology currently being used.\n\nThe participants will be mentored as part of a larger field team to learn the field protocols for the vegetation measurements within the 2 permanent forest plots of HIPPNET. Field research in the 4 hectare forest plots will involve collecting information for every tree that is greater than 1 cm diameter in size and specifically will involve tree identification, tagging and marking new trees, mapping new trees into the geo-referenced database, collecting tree diameter data, collecting growth habit data, and estimating abundance of herbaceous vegetation. The 2 HIPPNET sites are within different forest types thus providing experience in both tropical wet and dry forests and the opportunity to learn the vegetation communities of these two forest types on Hawaii Island.\n\nParticipants will also gain experience in the quality assurance and quality control protocols used by HIPPNET in the field and with the larger dataset. Participants will have the opportunity to learn about how the data is analyzed to answer research questions related to forest dynamics if there is interest by the participant. The fellowship will be primarily field based and out of the USDA Forest Service – Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry office in Hilo, HI.  It will involve hiking steep and rough terrain and standing for long durations. Field conditions can be cold, hot, wet, windy, and/or dry.  \n\nLearning Objectives: The internship will help the successful applicant build knowledge, experience, and competence in the following areas:\n\nPlant identification and vegetation monitoring techniques\nStandard ecological sample processing protocols \nData entry, management, and analysis\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Susan Cordell (susan.cordell@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: September 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for 10 months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is part time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $400 - $480 per week.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\n\nQuestions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email ORISE.USFS.PSWRS@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.\n\nQualifications\nThe qualified candidate should be currently pursuing a master's degree in the one of the relevant fields (e.g. a field related to Ecology, Environmental Geography, Forestry, or the Biological Sciences).\n\nPreferred skills:\n\nBasic background in the Biological Sciences, including either completed credit hours in Botany, Biology, Ecology, Environmental science or related coursework, or previous experience in the field and/or laboratory collecting biological data. \nThe ability to navigate in the field using GPS units, compasses, and maps.\nPrevious experience conducting biological scientific data in the field and in identifying native Hawaiian plants is favorable.\nPrevious experience with off road driving (4x4), a valid driver's license, and no major traffic violations is also favorable.\nContact\nUSDA-FS-PSWRS-2025-0101\ncontact via the web posting is preferred (see Details section)",
