Understanding how these young forest stands contribute as stopover habitat for migrating songbirds is of critical importance. This project provides a unique opportunity to evaluate use of regenerating forest stands by migrating songbirds in a large and patchily disturbed landscape. The student will determine occupancy and abundance using mist-nets and using Autonomous Recording Units (ARUs). The student will use pre-existing models to identify study areas. This research is in collaboration with National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc., National Alliance of Forest Owners, and Weyerhaeuser Company under the auspices of the Wildlife Conservation Initiative, and Cornell University. \n\nThe student will be working towards an MS in Wildlife and Fisheries Resources at West Virginia University. STARTING DATE: August 2025. The ideal applicant must be able to identify central Appalachian avian species by sight and sound and have extensive experience with mist-netting and handling birds. Applicants should also be familiar with collecting measurements of forest structure, including but not limited to: DBH, canopy cover (using spherical densiometers), Robel pole, Daubenmire frame, etc. Preference will be given to applicants with experience in R statistical packages, GIS, and song file analysis via RavenPro or similar software. Applicants should be comfortable working long days in the field during spring and fall months, ready to travel, and energetic and excited about applied avian conservation research on private working forests. Applicants will also be responsible for hiring and supervising a research technician to assist with research duties. Applicants must have completed a BS in Wildlife Biology, Ecology, or a closely related field. A minimum of 300 combined GRE score (V+Q) or 1100 on the previous scale, and a minimum 3.25 GPA are considered competitive. \n\nTuition waiver is included.\n\nTo Apply: Electronic applications are preferred.

The opportunity may be remote.\n\nAt the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency\u2019s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It\u2019s been there from the agency\u2019s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nThe mission of the United States Forest Service (USFS) Southern Research Station (SRS) is to create science and technology needed to sustain and enhance forest ecosystems and the benefits they provide. The Center for Economics and Social Science (CESS), located within USFS-SRS, includes the Forest Economics and Policy Unit (RWU-4804). The research mission of the unit is to advance the science between natural and human-caused disturbances and economic values, and how those disturbances can be managed to reduce undesired impacts on society and ecosystems.\n\nResearch Project: The Forest Economic and Policy Unit is seeking an ORISE participant to help quantify the economic effectiveness of wildfire prevention programs (and their associated \u201cactivities\u201d) at reducing human-caused wildfires on Tribal lands in the United States. The purpose of this experience will be to quantify temporal and spatial effects of fire prevention programs on human ignitions by including individual management practices from a time series dataset. We expect that the participant will use econometric methods to approach this research objective.\n\nLearning Objectives: The ORISE participant will learn about relevant fire prevention programs, fire prevention activities, and associated datasets. In addition, the participant will receive guidance with novel econometric techniques, and receive support with scientific writing.\n\nThe participant will have the opportunity to collaborate and receive mentorship from scientists and mangers in USFS and Bureau of Indian Affairs. The participant will develop scientific writing and econometric skills, as well as increase proficiency using statistical software (such as STATA or R). The mentor will encourage dissemination of results among managers and research groups.  \n\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Sonia Bruck (sonia.bruck@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be until December 30, 2025, but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is part time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $3,000-$3,500 per month.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation. Foreign national candidates may have a mandatory in-person requirement depending on visa status.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service.

The position is unpaid, but stipends are available to cover expenses and to reward accomplishments. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will rapidly gain valuable professional experience by playing an integral role on the WRF team. Work to build WRF\u2019s bear conservation capacity and impact on Teton National Park bears as you contribute and strengthen your conservation knowledge and skills. Gain recognition for your efforts among area partners, on the WRF website, and elsewhere, as you participate in meeting WRF\u2019s mission, which is to increase park wildlife population viability both ex situ and in situ, working closely with National Parks and Forests, zoo partners, and park gateway communities.\n\n\nWRF operates effectively and efficiently and generates resources that enable measurable, boots-on-the-ground conservation results. The WRF Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will focus on implementation of the \u201cI Am Bear Safe\u201d Project in small towns neighboring Teton National Park\u2019s gateway communities in Montana. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will collaborate with the WRF President, Director of Communications, and other team members in connection to the \u201cI Am Bear Safe\u201d Project.\n\n\n [https://www.wildlifeandparks.org/projects].\n\n\n\u201cI Am Bear Safe\u201d\u2122 (IABS) is a multi-partner Wildlife Coexistence Strategy designed to equip National Park gateway community chambers of commerce and their member businesses (\u201cPark Gateway Partners\u201d) to \u201ctrain people not to train bears\u201d to get in the trouble they are in now because of human behavior\u2014a situation that is assuring bear demise. Bears are a top attraction at many National Parks and are well-managed within the parks to avoid human interaction. But communities at the park\u2019s edge are not sufficiently prepared or equipped for the increasing pressure of more visitors coupled with rapid development, na\u00efve new residents, and a growing number of recreationists in bear country. Park Gateway Partner (PGP) businesses are the perfect intervention point and receive marketing benefits from participating in the IABS town-based bear stewardship effort. WRF provides customized tools (signage and SWAG) that equip PGPs to effectively intercept park visitors and recreationists and equip them to be bear stewards who act responsibly by securing attractants and following park rules for recreating in bear habitat. The IABS goal is that bears perform their natural behaviors and survive without risk and distraction caused by humans.\n\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nTrack the inventory of IABS materials distributed to PGPs in each town.\nDistribute IABS Toolkit materials to PGPs and redistribution points.\nRecruit new PGPs, as appropriate and assigned.\nField questions and relay PGP concerns to WRF.\nAttend meetings of the chamber of commerce or local partner organization on occasion.\nMail out reward IABS reward magnets to Bear Quiz-takers.\nCome up with novel ideas to make the IABS Project more effective.\n\nEducation & Experience\n\nBachelor\u2019s degree in a relevant subject is required; graduate degree helpful.\nKnowledge and experience specific to grizzly and black bears required.\nExperience working with community-based organizations and/or local businesses.\n\nWRF Bear Conservation Specialists are asked to participate in an initial training then designate 16 hours a week to WRF and agree to work with WRF for 4 months. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) Should be a self-starter, ambitious, creative, productive, and dedicated to WRF\u2019s mission. S/he must also exhibit a high degree of professionalism, accountability, and ability to follow instructions and manage time well. S/he should be friendly and approachable, well-spoken, bold, and personable.  The internship is unpaid, but stipends are provided for approved expenses and as results are achieved. \n\n\nThe Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will report to Julie Anton Randall, WRF President.

Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency\u2019s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It\u2019s been there from the agency\u2019s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: The PNWRS Lab in Wenatchee, Washington has a six-decade history of collaborating with eastern WA National Forests to develop geospatial scripts and tools that characterize forest vegetation conditions and changes occurring over the 20th and 21st centuries and expected changes in conditions and disturbance processes over 21st century. Together the Forests and the Lab also build decision support tools that support a Forest-wide strategies to create healthy and wildfire adapted forests and a toolkit for evaluating current conditions and adapting them to wildfires and warming.\n\nThis project creates updates in a landscape evaluation toolkit, which include new models for listed and sensitive species. These models can inform managers during planning on how to improve forest health and reduce adverse consequences to sensitive species. Revisions also include updating values in the existing models that reflect new science and lessons learned over the last 15-years. The toolkit also includes evaluation tools that show current wildfire risk, overly dense forest conditions, and opportunities for transitioning forest conditions that are adapted to 21st century wildfires and drying environmental conditions through management.\n\nLearning Objectives: The fellow will develop professionally while engaging in research-operational partnerships and learning about systems involving forest composition, structure, insect and disease vulnerability, and fuels and fire emissions. They will gain experience with modeling, coding, and database management in support of a complex workflow. The fellow will gain valuable experience in decision support science while improving existing tools. The fellow will collaborate with others at the USDA Forest Service, Okanagan-Wenatchee National Forest and will have the opportunity to improve professional collaboration and communication skills.\n\nMentor: The mentors for this opportunity are Brion Salter (robert.salter@usda.gov) and Dr. Paul Hessburg (paul.hessburg@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $60,000 - $75,000 annually.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service.

The historian at JODA will engage in researching and writing a comprehensive history of how JODA has been managed from 1996 to the present day, including important issues in planning, land acquisition, development, public relations, and other topics of ongoing management concern. The final narrative reference will consist of a scholarly examination of the administrative history of the unit and will serve as a valuable tool for future park managers and scholars. The research effort resulting from this project will significantly expand the site\u2019s reference and archival files and provide additional information for park staff. Finally, the administrative history will be placed on JODA\u2019s website to make the information widely available to the public.\nA chronology of land acquisitions, paleontology research, archaeology surveys, park developments, special programs, resource protection and mitigation, and personnel changes are necessary to conduct many aspects of everyday park operations as well as in preparation for the Park\u2019s 50-year anniversary in 2025. There has been a high degree of turnover at the Park recently. As such, there has been a great deal of loss of institutional memory. Having a new administrative history will help capture institutional knowledge and prevent further loss. The historian will create a published scholarly, and comprehensively updated report bridging the gap between the last administrative history report, in 1996, and the present. This report will be a substantial aid in the documentation of the history of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.\nDescription:\nThe updated administrative history will include photos and graphics as well as a comprehensive assessment of primary and secondary sources in local, regional, state and national archives.

    "requirements": "Description\n\nThe Great Basin Institute will recruit and support an Administrative Historian who will complete a new administrative history for John Day Fossil Beds National Monument (JODA). The historian at JODA will engage in researching and writing a comprehensive history of how JODA has been managed from 1996 to the present day, including important issues in planning, land acquisition, development, public relations, and other topics of ongoing management concern. The final narrative reference will consist of a scholarly examination of the administrative history of the unit and will serve as a valuable tool for future park managers and scholars. The research effort resulting from this project will significantly expand the site\u2019s reference and archival files and provide additional information for park staff. Finally, the administrative history will be placed on JODA\u2019s website to make the information widely available to the public.\nA chronology of land acquisitions, paleontology research, archaeology surveys, park developments, special programs, resource protection and mitigation, and personnel changes are necessary to conduct many aspects of everyday park operations as well as in preparation for the Park\u2019s 50-year anniversary in 2025. There has been a high degree of turnover at the Park recently. As such, there has been a great deal of loss of institutional memory. Having a new administrative history will help capture institutional knowledge and prevent further loss. The historian will create a published scholarly, and comprehensively updated report bridging the gap between the last administrative history report, in 1996, and the present. This report will be a substantial aid in the documentation of the history of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.\nDescription:\nThe updated administrative history will include photos and graphics as well as a comprehensive assessment of primary and secondary sources in local, regional, state and national archives.  Oral history interviews will be conducted with present and former NPS staff, park partners, volunteers and others. These interviews will require travel to meet individuals both within the commuting distance of the park and outside of it.

This project is based at three long-term ecohydrological research sites (Soaproot, Newt Creek, and Providence), which are managed by the PSWRS of the USDA FS in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nAt the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency\u2019s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It\u2019s been there from the agency\u2019s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: The participant will engage in field-based research examining the impacts of wildfire and drought-induced tree mortality on water quality and quantity in headwater forest ecosystems.\n\nThe participant will collect water and gas samples from boreholes, soils, and streams, with a focus on capturing spatiotemporal variation in hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to disturbance. Specific activities will include participating in field campaigns to monitor moisture dynamics, collecting and analyzing water samples for major ions, nutrients, water stable isotopes, and carbon isotopes, and assisting in the maintenance and calibration of field instrumentation.\n\nLaboratory activities will involve preparing and analyzing samples using techniques such as ion chromatography and isotope ratio spectroscopy. The participant will collaborate closely with graduate students and project collaborators to synthesize results, compare site responses, and contribute to research on how forest structure and climate extremes shape water availability and watershed function.\n\nLearning Objectives: This opportunity will provide training in hydrologic instrumentation, sample analysis, and environmental data interpretation, supporting the agency\u2019s mission to advance science-based forest and water resource management.\n\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is David Dralle (david.dralle@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for 3 months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $16,251.10 monthly.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\n\nQuestions: Please visit our Program Website.

Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency\u2019s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It\u2019s been there from the agency\u2019s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: This project will evaluate smoke emissions over a broad range of fuel, fuel moisture, and meteorological conditions and prescribed, cultural, and wildfire burn events. Using available software platforms, smoke emission factors and total smoke production by factor will be accounted for and differenced for the range of burn conditions as above. This research will involve a collaborative process with Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forests and create geospatial tools for wildfire, prescribed burning, and cultural burning related smoke trade-off analyses and quantitative forest landscape restoration and decision support. Results and findings will be submitted to one or more leading peer-reviewed journals, and presentations will be provided to Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest and other partners, along with the databases we create. The geospatial smoke tradeoffs dataset can then be used in project planning.\n\nLearning Objectives: The fellow will develop professionally while engaging in research-operational partnerships and learning about systems involving forest fuels and fire emissions modeling. They will gain experience with modeling, coding, and database management in support of a complex, multi-model ecological forecasting workflow. The fellow will gain valuable experience in advanced model development, calibration, and synthesis of the forest succession, fire severity, and climate change components of this workflow. The fellow will collaborate at the USDA Forest Service, Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest and will have the opportunity to improve professional collaboration and communication skills.\n\nMentor: The mentors for this opportunity are Brion Salter (robert.salter@usda.gov) and Dr. Paul Hessburg (paul.hessburg@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: As soon as possible, however onboarding may not start until September. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $60,000.00 \u2013 $75,000.00 Yearly.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service.

Young Drive South (Los Angeles, California)\nTags:\nFaculty / Post-Doc Appointments\nDescription\nThe UCLA La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science invites applications for its 2026 Postdoctoral Fellowship in California Conservation Science. We seek to hire one or more postdoctoral scholars who conduct innovative biological research at the interface of applied and basic science. Our long-term goal is to help fund a cadre of innovative young scientists who will work closely with UCLA faculty, help broaden the mission of conservation science for the campus, and lead to long-term collaborations between our academic scientists and applied conservation practitioners that will direct and lead California conservation efforts.\n\nCandidates may work in any discipline that provides the scientific underpinnings for the preservation, protection, management, or restoration of at-risk species, environments, or ecological communities in California. Current and past La Kretz Postdocs have worked on a wide variety of research topics, ranging from urban biodiversity and evolutionary adaptation, to wildfire management and conservation, to the interface of conservation and animal behavior; we are open to work in any California ecosystem or group of organisms, as long as the research is innovative, creative, and has clear practical significance. An important initiative, the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP), is a large, multi-campus initiative led by the La Kretz Center that is delivering genomic resources to California decision-makers to enhance species and habitat management, and candidates may seek to build off of that project in the realm of conservation genomics. For a full description of past fellows and their work, please visit us at https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/lakretz/\n\nFellows must have both an on-campus UCLA mentor, and an off-campus, non-university mentor. The on-campus UCLA mentor must also be a La Kretz Center affiliate. A list of applicable affiliates is available at https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/lakretz/people/. \n\nThe Fellow is expected to work closely with their identified UCLA mentor and one or more off-campus agency partner(s) in developing their project. All applications should include a letter (which may be brief) from each mentor stating their support for the project, what they can contribute to it, and how it fits into their work in conservation biology. Applications that do not include these letters of support will be considered incomplete and ineligible for consideration, and we strongly advise candidates to secure mentor support as early as possible. While we encourage project proponents to identify co-funding, from mentors or other agencies, co-funding is not a requirement. Off-campus mentors may be drawn from any California agency or NGO, including federal and state groups. A partial list of some of our active partners and contact people includes:\n\nThe Nature Conservancy: Sophie Parker (restoration; urban conservation; invasive species)\nNote: TNC has been a particularly active partner and cofunder in recent years, and we encourage applicants working with TNC mentors to consult : https://tnc.box.com/s/uetrddu6sncp3nipgn8a1hh6fi3jisgi\nLA Natural History Museum: Jann Vendetti (mollusk ecology and evolution; species natural history)\nUS Geological Survey: Robert Fisher (applied conservation; biodiversity; ecology and evolution)\nUS Geological Survey: Damian Higgins (research manager, western ecological research center)\nUS Bureau of Land Management: Mike Westphal (applied conservation, climate change)\nUS Fish and Wildlife Service: Cat Darst (endangered species management)\nNatural Communities Coalition: James Sulentich/Danny L. Fry (protection/recovery of sensitive species)\nNational Park Service: Katy Delaney (amphibian and avian ecology, evolution, and conservation)\nNational Park Service: Seth Riley (mammalian ecology, evolution, and conservation)\nThe La Kretz Fellowship is for two years, subject to review after the first year. The target start date is September 2026, but this date is quite flexible. The position offers a competitive salary, full benefits, and a research/travel allowance of $7500.

The GLOBE research group, led by Vojt\u011bch Kubelka from Department of Zoology and Centre for Polar Ecology at the Faculty of Sciences, University of South Bohemia in the Czech republic, has been recently awarded a prestigious ERC CZ grant: Animal migrations in a changing world \u2013 still advantageous strategy or maladaptive behaviour? for five years till 2029.\n\n\nAnimal migrations represent one of the greatest spectacles in nature, providing crucial ecosystem services as well as resources for human communities. Why do animals migrate? It has been thought that animals migrate to reproduce at higher latitudes, taking advantage of lower predation pressure, fewer parasites and seasonally high pulses in food supply. However, it has been highlighted that recent climate change and human pressure impacts can erode such benefits and migratory animals are declining globally with poorly understood underlying mechanisms.\n\n\nWe strive to tackle pressing issues: Are there still latitudinal gradients in predation, parasitism and seasonal food availability, supporting the benefits of migratory behaviour? How are migratory animals able to cope with environmental changes? What are the most important drivers and life stages limiting populations of migratory animals? To achieve this, we are executing comprehensive research of migration profitability, combining experimental, observational and comparative approaches \u2013 investigating latitudinal gradients in predation, parasites, food supply and whole life-cycles of tracked shorebirds, a suitable model taxon with intra-specific variability in migratory strategies and exposed ground nests \u2013 at 16 study sites from the Arctic to Patagonia.\n\n\nWe seek to appoint an early career scientist as post-doctoral researcher to contribute to this new project.\n\n\nWhat would be your main responsibilities\n\nOrganize and conduct ornithological field work at selected study sites across Western Palearctic and South America in association with international collaborators\nCombine experimental and observational fieldwork with a comparative approach based on extracting relevant information from published literature\nCoordinate data collection and analyses, working with large datasets in relational databases\nPrepare and write manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals\nLead or participate in funding applications for research in collaboration with team members\nSupervise students and research assistants\nParticipate in conservation activities\nPresent and promote the results at conferences and seminars\nDisseminate the project outputs to stakeholders and public,\nCarry out other scientific and/or academic activities that are important for the success of the project\n\nWhat we offer\n\nA two-year position with the possibility of extension based on the performance\nExcellent instruments, equipment and multiple research platforms within the Faculty of Sciences, University of South Bohemia in \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, Czech Republic\nAccess to the Czech Arctic research station at Svalbard and fieldwork at study sites along latitudinal gradients from Morocco to Arctic and from tropical South America to Patagonia\nExtensive international networking and mentoring opportunities\nFull logistical support for own follow-up research funding applications\nEnglish speaking, stimulating & friendly international research environment\nHR Award certificate, jcu.cz/about-the-university/development/hr-award-hrs4r\nProfessional administration support and assistance with all personal, economic, legal, project, IT, intellectual property needs, flexible working time\nCompetitive salary + possible bonuses, 5 weeks of paid vacation per year\nMeals allowance, special mobile services, university kindergarten\nWork-life balance in a historical middle-sized university city, cz/en/\n\nCompetitive candidates are expected to have\n\nPhD in evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology, zoology, or relevant field of life sciences\nA foundation of knowledge in two or more fields: evolutionary ecology, climate change biology, demography and population dynamics, predator-prey interactions and animal migration\nExperience in conducting or supervising international research projects\n3+ years hands-on experience in field research, with preference for experience with fieldwork in tropical or Arctic locations\nOrnithological fieldwork experience including bird handling and ringing (bird ringing licence is welcomed but not necessary)\nGood skills in statistical modelling, advanced level in using R\nStrong record of success conducting research and scholarly activities, including publications in peer-reviewed journals\nExperience working with analysis and presentation of large data sets\nDemonstrated project management experience and leadership skills\nBudgetary and general administrative skills\nExcellent interpersonal skills and ability to collaborate within a team-based environment, ability to work effectively both in a team and independently\nValid driving licence\n\n\nLocation description \n\nCeske Budejovice is a vibrant medium-sized city and centre of South Bohemian region with an international university community.

The intern will have three central projects while serving at DEWA.\n\nBilingual Public Programs:\nThe first project is to build upon previous programmatic and community engagement successes by providing at least four bilingual public programs throughout the summer. A fluent Spanish-speaking visitor services presence is a significant need at the park and would greatly increase outreach to Latino visitors. DEWA staff have developed and initiated a very popular waterfall walk along an accessible trail, which would be an excellent opportunity for the intern to present to Spanish-speaking groups. Topics may include watersheds, migrations, adaptations, forest forensics, and more!\n\nTranslating Park Publications:\nThe second project for the Latino Heritage Intern would be to translate park publications and maps from English to Spanish. This would allow park rangers who are not bilingual to provide Spanish-speaking visitors with appropriate information for a safe and enjoyable visit.\n\nRiver and Beach Access Sites:\nThe third project is to improve access to popular river and beach sites within the park by providing orientation, water safety information, and audience-centered interpretation to groups. The intern will be given time and support to develop pop-up programs, beach programs, and/or an introductory Spanish-language Junior Ranger Program to engage families in lessons and activities about river safety. (Over the past three years, there have been five visitor drownings at DEWA, with 40% of the victims speaking Spanish as their first language.)\n\nAdditionally, DEWA is partnering with Latino Outdoors, Outdoor Afro, and NPCA to provide guided hikes. The Latino Heritage Intern would prepare for the hikes with the park\u2019s supervisory ranger and have the opportunity to coordinate, lead, and strengthen visitor relationships with resources and recreational opportunities. Interns will also collaborate with seasonal employees, partners, volunteers, and supervisory staff to attend community programs and outreach events with the goal of reaching Spanish-speaking visitors.\n\n \n\nResponsibilities:\n\n Fluency in Spanish\nInterest in embracing new opportunities\nWillingness to develop and build self-awareness\n \n\nQualifications:\n\nEducational/Experience Requirements:\n\nAt least two years of coursework toward a degree in biological sciences or two years of field experience related to natural resource/vegetation work\nOne semester of coursework related to geospatial data\nClearance:\n\nGovernment security background clearance required before starting\nWork Abilities:\n\nAbility to work productively both independently and as part of a team\nEffective communication with team members, agency staff, and a diverse public\nPhysical ability to:\nHike up to 10 miles daily on uneven terrain with a pack\nWork in harsh and rapidly changing environments\nTraverse uneven terrain and carry up to 40 pounds in a backpack\nMaintain good physical condition\nFieldwork Requirements:\n\nWillingness to spend multiple days camping in the field, as needed\nOrganizational Skills:\n\nStrong organizational abilities\n  \n\nInterns in this program will receive 800 hours towards Public Land Corps (PLC) Hiring Authority.

Its primary purpose is to serve the original needs of the NGO\u2019s operations which are wildlife conservation through research and education. This is accomplished through the layout of the farm which provides extensive wildlife habitat and foraging opportunities, increasing the local faunal biodiversity as well as acting as an educational demonstration to local subsistence farmers and visiting students.  \nInterns will learn by assisting in implementation and evaluation of management practices, cropping, and record keeping on the farm with this vision in mind while we endeavor to maximize the products coming from the farm with the existing design and layout using sustainable and regenerative practices specific to the Mesoamerican uplands. Within this broad framework, intern projects can include several basic Agricultural Education disciplines including Tropical Agriculture, Sustainable/organic Agriculture, Farm Management, Waste management, and Agricultural Economics.  \nIn addition to planting crops, we also have free range chickens and ducks for eggs and meat. We are looking to increase our revenue generation from the farm either in the form of increased accountable products entering our kitchen for use in our restaurant, or for sale to the Mobile Market or in a proposed road-side caf\u00e9 which would be managed by T.R.E.E.S kitchen and hospitality staff. Thus, interns would also assist us with marketing strategy for existing products and/or planting. \nBy the successful conclusion of this internship, the student will be able to apply practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species, basic free range poultry operations, evaluate different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns, and become familiar with sustainable management practices such as no/low till, cover cropping, waste management, mulching, marketing, Farm-to-Table, etc. \n Requirements: \nNo prior tropical agriculture experience required. Interns can be current undergraduate or graduate students enrolled in a program with their University/College for credit however non-students can also apply; but preference will be given to students enrolled in an accreditation program. Experienced tropical agriculturalists and/or agroforestry professionals are also welcome and will be treated according to their experience level and are eligible for *discounted rates. \n Internship Responsibilities: \nApplying practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species and basic free range poultry operations. \nEvaluating different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns. \nWork on Inga Alley-cropping and other regenerative cropping practices, and using intercropping, organic fertilizing and pest control practices. \nAssist with innovative marketing strategies for existing products accompanied by reviewing projected budgets for the farm and their products and exploring cost/profit ratios for poultry husbandry. \nPlanting and selling new products for the farm. \nOpportunities are also available to observe and participate with concurrent intern and wildlife educational activities such as mist-netting, observing and recording measurements of bats, birds, herps, invertebrates, water quality, and much more. \nInterns will assist with creating captions for social media posts to engage and update followers on what has been going on at the field station and various projects that are being done. \n Internship Period: \nInterns can choose to do a minimum of 2 weeks to a maximum of 5 weeks during this Apprenticeship program, though 4 weeks is the recommended duration. \n Costs: \nThis internship has a fee of $184 USD/week which includes room and board (meals included Monday-Friday), full access to lab equipment, and training by professional on-site biologists. Food is not provided as part of the internship program. Interns can also purchase their own basic food supplies from nearby vendors that can be prepared simply on-site without access to a full kitchen OR interns can order meals from the on-site Toucan Caf\u00e9 restaurant that is open daily and caters to all dietary restrictions Lodging at the research center signifies a shared dormitory-style rustic cabins with other same sex interns with full access to other facilities such as showers, restrooms, and kitchen. The nature of this program allows interns to carry out most of the work independently after the training period is done. Fees do not include airport transfer, flights, travel medical insurance, or $100 USD visitor permit fee if remaining in country for more than 30 days.    \nWe are hoping to expand our internship program beyond North America. Citizens from Latin America and the Caribbean will be charged at a discounted rate of 50%. Belizeans will get another discount. For more information, kindly email Scandia Cruz with the email provided above. \n Schedule: \nInterns are required to work for 35 hours/week minimum.
