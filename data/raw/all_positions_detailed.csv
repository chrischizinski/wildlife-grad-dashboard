Description
The Wilder Lab in the Department of Biology at Oklahoma State University is seeking a highly motivated MS or PhD student to join a funded research project on the nutritional ecology of sexual cannibalism in spiders.

This project aims to investigate the dietary benefits of sexual cannibalism. The overall objective is to determine if specific nutrients from the male's body act as a dietary supplement for cannibalistic females, ultimately boosting the success of their offspring.

The research will involve a combination of fieldwork (collecting spiders) and laboratory experiments, testing how sexual cannibalism and various nutrient manipulations influence offspring production. Ideal candidates will have prior experience working with arthropods and a record of publishing peer-reviewed articles.

The position offers a flexible start date in January, May, or August 2026. The stipend is a combination of research and teaching assistantships and some summer support is available.

The student will be based in Stillwater, OK. Oklahoma State University is located near a variety of unique natural areas, including the Wichita Mountains and the Great Salt Plains, with easy access to other beautiful landscapes in Missouri and Arkansas.

Application review will begin on October 1. To apply, please submit the following as a single PDF to Dr. Shawn Wilder (shawn.wilder@okstate.edu):

Description
The Fish Ecology Laboratory in the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology invites applications for a funded graduate student to study questions related to the use of Tiger Muskellunge (sterile Northern Pike and Muskellunge hybrids) as biological control of introduced fish species. Introduced and invasive species are some of the greatest risks to conservation and management of native fishes. Stocking sterile fishes that are highly predatory (e.g., Tiger Muskellunge, triploid Walleye) is increasingly popular to control populations of undesirable fishes while maintaining the long-term goals of native species conservation. However, stocking of these sterile predators may not be compatible with other management activities. The successful candidate will design and conduct research to develop a set of best practices when using Tiger Muskellunge as biological control. Research components may include harmonizing long-term Colorado State data, field-based experiments, gut content and stable isotope analyses, bioenergetic modeling, population modeling, angler surveys, and quantitative literature review. The successful candidate will collaborate extensively with researchers at CSU as well as Colorado Parks and Wildlife researchers and biologists, who will be key partners in the project. 

Candidates must have: 
-        A MSc degree in fisheries, ecology, biology, or equivalent 
-        Demonstrated excellence in science communication (scientific writing, presentations) and quantitative skills 
 Ideal candidates will have some combination of experience in: 
-        Population modeling 
-        Management and analysis of large datasets 
-        Bioenergetic modeling 
-        Stable isotope analyses 
-        Fish ecology 
-        Field research 
-        Working with staff from agencies, non-governmental organizations, anglers, etc 
-        Familiarity with common programs used for analyses (e.g., R software) 
 Funding: The project is conditionally funded for 4 years through a combination of support from Colorado Parks and Wildlife and teaching assistantships. Funding includes graduate student stipend (~$36,000 USD per year), health insurance, and tuition. 

Application: Interested applicants should submit a letter of interest (1-2 pages) and a CV as one PDF file to: Dr. Zoe Almeida, l.zoe.almeida@colostate.edu and Dr. Jesse Lepak (please use subject line “PhD application: Bio Control”). Finalists will be invited to apply to the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology through the Colorado State University Graduate School (see https://warnercnr.colostate.edu/fwcb/graduate-study/how-to-apply/).

Description
We are searching for a PhD student to lead a new experimental study investigating how coyotes and wild pigs influence the behavior of deer and other mammals in the southeastern United States. Coyotes have relatively recently colonized the southeast, taking on the role of the largest carnivore across much of the region and exerting top-down effects on the native large herbivore (white-tailed deer) and other trophic levels. At the same time, wild pigs have spread across much of the southeast, and our recent research suggests they are impacting predator-prey dynamics in this system. However, disentangling the relative effects of coyotes and wild pigs individually on ecosystem processes has heretofore been limited due to the fact that both species occur ubiquitously across any area where they co-occur, i.e., studying the effects of one species in isolation from the other has been impossible. Therefore, with state and federal partners, we will be using large (100 acre) exclosures that will selectively exclude each of these target species. 

The student is expected to take part in this exciting new project (exclosures were just constructed) by developing research questions related specifically to deer and other mammalian responses to our experimental design. Within the study area we are placing GPS tracking collars on coyotes, deer and wild pigs, allowing the student to investigate questions regarding how removal of predation risk and/or risk of interacting with the dominant competitor (i.e., wild pigs) impact deer movement behavior, stress physiology, maternal care and fawn survival. We also have an extensive camera trap array and drift fences in place, making the system well suited to assess community-level responses by carnivores and other trophic levels. 

Applicants are required to have an MS in wildlife ecology or a related field, previous experience in studying the ecology of wildlife in a field setting, be a US citizen and have a valid US driver’s license. Top applicants will have a strong interest in the ecology of large mammals and their impact on other trophic levels, as well as evidence of strong scientific writing and basic statistics.  Applicants should submit a cover letter, CV, contact information for 3 references, unofficial transcripts, and a scientific writing sample as a single PDF titled “LastName_PhDapplication” to djachow@clemson.edu prior to September 22, 2025.  The selected student would start at Clemson in January 2026. 

The selected student will be awarded a 4-year graduate research assistantship (starting at $30,000/year, health benefits, along with tuition waiver) to attend Clemson University as a Fellow in the Clemson Boone and Crockett University Program. As a Boone and Crockett Fellow, the student will join a network of fellows at other universities with Boone and Crockett Programs and have access to several exclusive professional development opportunities. The student will be advised by Dr. David Jachowski within the Department of Forestry and Wildlife Conservation, with external advising from Dr. John Kilgo of the U.S. Forest Service. Clemson University is the largest public land grant university in the state of South Carolina and nationally recognized as an R1 (“very high research activity”) institution. Clemson is a small town located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains and along the shores of Lake Hartwell. Campus is surrounded by the 17,500-acre Clemson Experimental Forest, providing abundant opportunities for recreation, research and education.

Job Posting Title: Graduate Research Assistant in Aquaculture Systems and Stress Tolerance

Department: School of Renewable Natural Resources

Job Description: 

Position Description: 

The School of Renewable Natural Resources at Louisiana State University Agricultural Center is seeking applicants for one Ph.D. assistantship or one M.S. assistantship starting as early as January or May 2026, depending on candidate availability. The assistantship is half-time (20 hours/week) and includes a 12-month stipend of $28,000/year (MS) or $31,000/year (PhD), full tuition coverage, graduate fee support, and 75% graduate student health care coverage.

Project: 

The selected student will join a new lab group led by Dr. Kaelyn Fogelman, focused on understanding the physiological and energetic responses of aquatic organisms—particularly crayfish and unionid mussels—to environmental stressors. Research will involve laboratory and field-based investigations, including experimental work in live animal systems, physiological biomarker assays (e.g., respirometry, cellular energy allocation, or genotyping), and collaboration with commercial and academic partners.

Students will gain experience in experimental design, live animal handling and husbandry (especially in crayfish aquaculture systems), laboratory analysis, and stakeholder engagement. Projects may include controlled experiments in laboratory aquaculture systems or outdoor experimental ponds, as well as field sampling trips across Louisiana and the southeastern U.S.

This assistantship will play a critical role in helping build and shape a new research program and lab infrastructure. Therefore, preference will be given to students with a background or strong interest in aquaculture, animal husbandry, physiological ecology, or lab/field research coordination. The ability to work independently, problem-solve, and take initiative is essential, particularly during the startup phase of the lab.

The position will remain open until a qualified candidate is selected. Review of applications will begin October 1st, 2025.

Description
 California and the west are in the midst of a wildfire crisis due to an increase in catastrophic fires and decrease in good fire. One solution to these dueling crises is prescribed fire, and there is broad political support to increase its use. As the number of prescribed fires and their acreage increase in California, understanding their goals and effects are important. This research may help California Central Coast managers conduct better prescribed fires with their limited burn windows and capacity.
The student will be part of a collaborative, interdisciplinary team who evaluates prescribed fire effects on existing research and monitoring projects, which could be a MS thesis and peer-reviewed publication. Potential prescribed fire partners include Cal Fire units, UC Cooperative Extension, Prescribed Burn Associations, non-profits, private landowners, state and federal parks, Tribes, and more. Students may have an opportunity to pursue a prescribed fire project outside of the current research scope. Projects will generally be focused in the South Bay and Central Coast.

MS students would work with Dr. Kate Wilkin in the Biological Sciences Department’s Ecology and Evolution program at San Jose State University. Students would participate in the new Wildfire Interdisciplinary Research Center, which was recently awarded a NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC). WIRC provides potential internal research funding and interdisciplinary collaborations between ecology and social scientists, climatologists, fire weather, fire behavior modeling, combustion engineer, fire behavior monitoring, and remote sensing. 
Prescribed fire research includes:

Evaluate efficacy of novel field-based and remote sensing-based monitoring methods
Coastal prairie restoration
Photoload expansion to coastal prairies
Post-treatment herbaceous diversity and shrub status
Chaparral fire management


Other research and projects in the lab includes:

Home Ignition Zone (HIZ)
Fuel breaks and evacuation route clearance
Pyrodiversity
Youth fire education 



Funding: 
1st year funds available through existing grants. We will apply for 2nd year funds together. Students are expected to seek additional funding and tuition stipends may be available through competitive Biology Department teaching positions. Competitive internal research funding available through the new Wildfire Interdisciplinary Research Center, which is a NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center. Students are expected to apply to CalFire, Joint Fire Science Program, California Native Grasslands Association, Association for Fire Ecology, CSUBIOTECH, SJSU Biology Department Scholarships, and other student grant programs. Total funding is dependent on the project, and students will be trained in internal and external grant writing. 

Start date: Start as student in January 2026 OR Start as technician October 2025

 Job Title: Avian agroecology technician  

Description:
We are seeking 1-2 seasonal field technicians from mid-March through June 2026, with possible extension of work until July, to assist PhD student Karen Gallardo Cruz within the Karp Lab at UC Davis on a study examining the effects of tractor noise on barn owls in vineyards. Specifically, our project will explore how farm noise affects the behavior of barn owls and their rodent prey in vineyards. We will experimentally play tractor noise and track its effects on rodent boldness/abundance as well as on owl hunting in vineyards. We will also test an ‘audio lure’ that farmers may use to concentrate owl hunting in problem areas. This project is a collaboration between UC Davis (Karen Gallardo Cruz, Prof. Daniel Karp, Prof. Gail Patricelli), Cal Poly Humboldt (Prof. Matthew Johnson), and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (Prof. Clinton Francis). 

The field technician will work collaboratively to monitor barn owl nest boxes, quantify nestling growth, use GPS devices to track the movement of parent birds, monitor rodent boldness/abundance with camera traps and non-toxic bait stations, and conduct night-time surveys of owls with night-vision binoculars. Additionally, the field technician will assist in capture of parent birds to collect morphometric measurements, as well as fit/remove GPS tags via backpack harnesses. Other duties will include entering data, setting up/taking down heavy electronic equipment for noise experiments and nest box cameras, climbing tall orchard ladders to work with owl nest boxes, and other related tasks. Much of the fieldwork will occur at night-time, though there will also be daytime work. All fieldwork will occur in vineyards surrounding Lodi, CA. Field training will be provided to help the technician become familiar with established protocols and methodologies, but prior raptor-handling experience is a plus. A field vehicle and housing will be provided throughout the field season.  

Minimum qualifications:
1.     Some prior experience conducting ecological field work.
2.     Willingness to handle wildlife (barn owls, specifically).
3.     Able to tolerate heights, loud noises, night work, inclement weather, and irregular schedules.
4.     Comfortable working with minimal supervision, as well as part of a team.
5.     Able to follow standardized protocols and carefully record and enter data.
6.     Able to lift objects up to 50 lbs, carry them a short distance without assistance, and be able to carry heavier objects with assistance (to set up equipment for noise experiment).
7.     Self-directed, with professional and clear communication skills to coordinate with supervisor. 

Preferred qualifications:
1.     Prior bird handling experience, ideally with raptors or other large birds.
2.     Some prior data management experience (data entry and cleaning/review processes).
3.     Experience with bird banding and/or GPS tagging.
4.     Driver’s license and clean driving record (to operate provided university vehicle and drive between work locations when needed). 

Duration:
Mid-March 2026 through mid-June 2026, with a possible 2-week extension of work until July 2026. 

Wage:
Approximately $20-$23 per hour depending on prior experience. This is a full-time (40 hours per week), limited-term appointment through the University of California, Davis. Housing will be provided, and the successful applicant will be expected to relocate to the study region for the duration of the appointment.

To apply:
Email to Karen Gallardo Cruz (kgallardo@ucdavis.edu) a single document (PDF preferred) with the subject line “Avian agroecology technician” including: (1) a cover letter describing previous research experience (ideally with birds), interest in this position, description of how you meet the qualifications, and, briefly, why this position fits into your career goals; (2) a resume or CV; (3) contact information for two references 

Closing date:
First review date will be October 15th. Applications afterward will be considered thereafter on a rolling basis until the position is filled. 

The Karp Lab is committed to maintaining a supportive, inclusive, and safe scientific environment in the laboratory and the field. Applicants will receive field safety standards and training.  The University of California is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer.

Description
 The IMMS Animal Training Internship Program is designed as a way for students/individuals interested in a career in animal care and training to gain valuable experience in a real-world setting. Interns will primarily be trained in aspects of animal care, but will also participate in other activities at IMMS. Our goal is to give interns a well-rounded experience in a variety of areas while providing expert training and experience. 

The IMMS animal care and training staff is in charge of caring for Atlantic bottlenose dolphins, California sea lions, and large parrots. Interns will work directly with animal care staff and be exposed to all aspects of the daily routine. Heavy emphasis is placed on basic tasks such as food preparation, and daily cleaning and facility maintenance. Interns will learn how to train animals with operant conditioning through observation and may assist during sessions. Interns will also complete a project during their internship, as well as help staff with daily water quality. Because we want interns to have a well-rounded experience, they will also be asked to assist in other departments. Interns may participate as 1) environmental educators and assist in giving presentations to the public, 2) research assistants that help with our many wild dolphin-based research studies, or 3) emergency responders as IMMS is a part of the Southeast Regional Marine Mammal Stranding Network and responds to stranded marine mammals and sea turtles. 

Interested applicants must follow the directions listed on the website to apply. 

Interns must be: 

• 18 years or older. 

• A recent graduate or actively pursuing a college degree in the sciences. 

• Able to commit to a minimum of at least 12 weeks, 40 hours a week. The internship can be extended depending on work performance. 

• Available to work weekdays, weekends, and holidays. 

• Able to lift 50 lbs, work long hours on your feet, and work outside in extreme conditions. 

• Able to maintain a positive attitude, good work ethic, sense of responsibility, and a strong willingness to learn. 

• Financially stable enough to obtain housing and transportation, though IMMS staff will do their best to assist you in making arrangements. 

• Able to comply with IMMS rules and regulations.

*Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), located in Stuttgart, Arkansas.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: The mission of the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center is to improve the competitiveness of the U.S. rice industry in global and domestic markets through research and technology development that assure high yields, value-added grain quality, pest resistance and stress tolerance.  The shortage of irrigation water and increased night-time temperature have negatively impacted quality and quantity of rice production by intensification of pressure of both biotic and abiotic stress.  The participant will be involved in a team investigation of rice genes that are involved in resisting plant pathogens including Magnaporthe oryzae and stresses caused by extreme temperatures, weeds, and herbicides.

Learning Objectives: The participant will learn skills in the Protein Function and Phenotype Prediction SCINet group. They will learn to develop and deploy AI-based protein structure prediction tools that are available to the SCINet community of researchers via high-performance computing. They will also gain experience in generating fungal pan-genome resources including the evaluation of disease resistance, yield, protein, grain element, plant and microbe DNA, RNA purification and DNA sequencing analysis using next gen DNA sequencing, gene expression using RNA seq or real time PCR. Open sources of bioinformatic tools including the use of AlphaFold and databases will be used for functional characterization.  This opportunity will enable the participant develop skills needed for investigating host-pathogen interactions and improving plant health using machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Yulin Jia (yulin.jia@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: October 2025. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for two years, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $65,000 - $75,000 annually.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

 Emergency Response – APHIS is an emergency response agency.  This means that all Agency employees may be asked or assigned to participate in rotating temporary duty assignments to support emergency programs at some time during their careers with APHIS.  It is difficult to predict the frequency with which such emergency situations may occur – and could range from several emergencies in a year to none over the course of many years.  In the event that you are called upon to support an emergency program, this may require irregular working hours, including overtime, and may include duties other than those specified in your official position description.

In addition, it may be necessary for employees to participate in multiple rotations to an emergency program assignment.  Attempts will be made to keep disruption to the employee to a minimum.

It is difficult to predict the frequency with which such emergency situations may occur – and could range from several emergencies in a year to none over the course of many years.  In the event that you are called upon to support an emergency program, this may require irregular working hours, including overtime, and may include duties other than those specified in your official position description.
