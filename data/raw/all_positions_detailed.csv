Graduate Opportunities
Description
The Department of Biology at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) is recruiting doctoral students for Fall 2026! All PhD students are guaranteed a full five years of funding, including salary, tuition, and healthcare.
 
 Our department spans a wide range of cutting-edge topics and techniques in biological research, with four major research areas: genomics, microbiology, ecology and evolution, and cellular, molecular and developmental biology. Our PhD program focuses on training students to apply sophisticated quantitative techniques to solve research problems in these areas, giving our graduates a competitive advantage for careers in industry, government, or academia. 
 Applicants can either apply to single labs (direct entry), or apply to enter the rotation program, which gives students the opportunity to conduct research in three labs before deciding which to join. Applications are due on December 1, 2025. Applicants should contact faculty and identify potential advisors before applying – you can begin by consulting the list of recruiting labs below!
 Recruiting professors include:
 Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
JC Buckner: The IDER lab integrates genetics, morphometrics and paleontological data to understand biodiversity dynamics and adaptation in terrestrial tetrapods. Potential graduate students would contribute to our waterfowl research on consequences of introgression for population viability and the genetic basis of convergent phenotypes. Please visit our website, iderlab.org, to learn more.
 Luke Frishkoff: The Frishkoff Lab seeks to understand the evolution and maintenance of biodiversity from local communities to large geographic regions as well as how human impacts are recasting these ecological and evolutionary patterns. We conduct community ecology field research on reptiles and amphibians in Texas, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.
 Alison Ravenscraft: Our ultimate goal is to understand how the bacterial symbionts of insects impact ecosystem-level processes such as plant consumption and pollination. We study both the pairwise bug-Caballeronia symbiosis, and the entire gut microbiome of herbivorous insects (beetles, grasshoppers and caterpillars). We ask whether, when, and how environmentally acquired gut microbiota influence these insects’ responses to stressors such as extreme climates, pesticides, and natural plant defenses.
 Matt Walsh: The Walsh lab evaluates the ecological drivers of evolutionary change in killifish on the island of Trinidad and waterfleas in lakes in Alaska.
 Cellular, Molecular, and Developmental Biology
Loic Fort: The Fort Lab investigates how human stem cells decide their fate on their journey to becoming cardiac cells. We are especially interested in understanding how physical forces influence these decisions. By combining 2D and 3D stem cell models with advanced imaging and molecular tools such as CRISPR, we aim to uncover the fundamental rules of human development and how these processes are disrupted in patients with congenital heart disease.
 Alicia Rogers: The Rogers Lab seeks to understand how small RNA-mediated gene regulation maintains robust execution of cellular and physiological processes during normal and stress conditions. We aim to establish a comprehensive map of the regulatory logic embedded within small RNA pathways that coordinates pathway homeostasis and robust gene expression.
 Anita Quintana: The Quintana lab seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms by which genetic (pathogenic) variants cause birth defects. We have a specific focus on birth defects that disrupt brain and craniofacial development. Our laboratory uses zebrafish as a model system to study development. Zebrafish are an amazing developmental model because they are fertilized outside of their mother allowing for the visualization of development in real time.
 Genomics
Todd Castoe: Population genomics of speciation to link theory with empirical data; Population genomics of schistomiasis transmission and the impact of control measures on natural selection. Genome-wide association studies to link traits with selection in the context of speciation and hybridization. 
 Jeff Demuth: The Demuth Lab studies the evolution of sex chromosomes and molecular genetics of behavior, primarily using beetles as a model system.
 Daniela Palmer: We are interested in understanding the genetic underpinnings of biodiversity, especially in sex-related traits. We study the evolution of sex chromosomes and other parts of the genome that contribute to sex-specific adaptation. Our research focuses on a group of insects known as treehoppers that show fascinating diversity in morphology, behavior, and beyond.

 Microbiology
Qing Tang: Bacterial physiology, pathogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, and host interactions of human pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. We use both cell-culture and mouse models.

Anticipated Start: Spring 2026 
Anticipated Salary: $30,000 plus tuition waiver 
Application Deadline: Open until filled 

Position Description: Invasive species significantly alter fire regimes, impacting fire risk in the southeastern USA. Current fuel models often overlook invasive species, leading to inaccurate fire risk assessments and management decisions. The student will lead a Joint Fire Sciences funded project to address this gap by developing new fuel models that incorporate the impacts of invasive species on fire behavior. The student will collect temporally explicit field data on fuel parameters associated with different levels of plant invasion for multiple species, develop custom fuel models used to parameterize fire behavior models, and use large-scale available data on invasive species occurrence and wildfires to assess changes in fire regimes region wide. The field component of the study will be conducted in two locations within the Gulf Coast region: Grand Bay National Wildlife Refuge and University of Florida’s Jay Research Facility. The student will be expected to lead field work, collect and compile remotely sensed data, conduct quantitative statistical analyses, present their findings at relevant scientific conferences, complete relevant course work, and publish their findings in the peer-reviewed literature. The student will work closely with students and scientists from other labs at the University of Florida and Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve as part of a regional team. 

Preferred Qualifications: The successful candidate will have a BS and MS degree in ecology or a related field, a valid driver’s license, experience with fuel sampling, fire behavior modeling, and with R and GIS for statistical and spatial analyses. In addition, they will have strong writing, communication, leadership, and organization skills and the ability to work independently and as part of a team. Please submit a cover letter explaining why you are pursuing a graduate degree and why you believe our lab is the right fit for you, plus a CV, unofficial transcript, and two references to Carissa Wonkka at c.wonkka@ufl.edu. Submit documents as a single PDF file named “[your last name] PhD JFSP.pdf”. 

About us: The Wonkka Lab employs multi-scale experiments to assess the response of functional processes, energy flows, biotic relationships, and biotic-abiotic interactions within ecological communities to common restoration and management techniques. We design studies to understand the interactions among processes, vegetation, soils, insects, animals, and human decision-making that underpin complex social-ecological system dynamics. Our research supports long-term sustainable ecosystem restoration and management that is resilient to global-change related shifts in biophysical and environmental conditions, socio-political conditions, and disturbance regimes.

Description
Project Description: The Padilla Applied Wildlife Science (PAWS) group at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is in search of a PhD student to work on population ecology and demographic modeling of an invasive ungulate, the aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) in the Chihuahuan Desert. The overarching aims of this effort is to combine field data from non-invasive (camera trap, fecal sampling) and invasive (GPS telemetry, harvest sampling) methods to estimate population size and population vital rates with the goal of parameterizing a demographic population model to inform management. In addition, we are interested in questions related to interspecific interactions (competition, predation, etc), parasitology and disease ecology are also of interest and the grad student will be expected to develop their own research questions within the project. Field work will largely be conducted at a rugged and remote research ranch along the US-Mexico border. 
 About me and the lab: The PI - Benjamin Padilla - is a new Assistant professor at UTEP with experience working in academia and for the state of Oregon’s Department of Fish and Wildlife. The PAWS group aims to use sound field and quantitative approaches to answer applied questions in wildlife ecology, management and conservation through collaboration, communication, and engagement with stakeholders. 
 About UTEP: UTEP is a Carnegie R1 (very high research activity) university with an active research community and a vibrant campus at the U.S.-Mexico border. El Paso offers unique field access to desert and mountain ecosystems, as well as a dynamic cultural environment that is often a pleasant surprise to first-time visitors. 

To Apply: Please send a CV and a brief cover letter describing your background and why you want to pursue a PhD and your interests in the topic. 
 This is an excellent opportunity for someone interested in a career in wildlife ecology and management, particularly for those who want to advance their skills with both statistical analysis and field biology. If you have questions about the university, the lab, or the project, check out the lab website (www.padilla-wildlife.weebly.com), or contact me, Benjamin Padilla (bjpadilla@utep.edu). Also, I will be at TWS in Edmonton in early October, if you are interested you can find me there!

Graduate assistantship focused on American black bear-moose interactions – we are seeking a highly motivated person to pursue a PhD degree in the Environmental and Life Sciences Graduate Program at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. The graduate student will join a large team implementing a field research project on the factors limiting and regulating moose populations in Ontario. The student project will be focused broadly on American black bear ecology with a focus on interactions with moose. Specific research questions will be determined collaboratively between the students and research team. The field project is a multi-year program that entails the GPS radio collaring of moose, American black bears, wolves and white-tailed deer to assess cause-specific mortality of moose and examine predator-prey dynamics. The successful applicant will have considerable responsibility and freedom to formulate and address basic and applied research questions grounded in ecological theory. Field work will be highly varied and will include live trapping and deployment of collars on black bears, wolves and white-tailed deer and helicopter capture of adult and calf moose. Further, the project involves deployment of remotely triggered trail cameras, collection of non-invasive samples for black bear population estimation, vegetation surveys, hunter surveys, aerial population surveys and more. The student will be expected to conduct significant field work for their specific project AND assist in all field aspects of the broader project. The student will be co-supervised by Dr. Joe Northrup and Dr. Brent Patterson both of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources & Trent University.

Seeking a highly motivated PhD for January 2026 to conduct research in conservation of the imperiled New England cottontail rabbit, at the University of New Hampshire, in Dr. Adrienne Kovach’s lab (http://www.kovachlab.com) in the Department of Natural Resources & the Environment. 
 The student will be supported on a Research Assistantship to conduct research to evaluate population abundance and viability for a threatened lagomorph. A focus will be to apply spatially explicit genetic mark-recapture abundance estimation with noninvasive genetic sampling and to develop models that predict density for known New England cottontail metapopulations and conservation focus areas. Additional work will include predictive population viability modeling in a spatially explicit context. The student may pursue additional research questions of their own design, which may center around additional population modeling and/or additional analyses of genetic data to address questions about landscape genetics and conservation genetics concerns. The research and modeling tools developed under this project will be applied to the conservation of New England cottontail populations through a range-wide conservation initiative. The New England Cottontail Conservation Initiative is a large, multi-state collaborative effort that has been focused for a dozen years on restoration of this at-risk species. Graduate students will be immersed in a network, including conservation partners and academic researchers collaborating in this initiative, providing strong outreach and engagement opportunities. Working within this system provides students an opportunity to participate in and help inform adaptive management. 
 The PhD student will be enrolled in the Natural Resources and Earth Systems Science (NRESS) program (https://www.unh.edu/nressphd). The University of New Hampshire is committed to social justice and actively creates an educational environment that fosters diversity, inclusion, and quality engagement for all.
 Qualifications: Successful candidates will have a background in wildlife/ecology/conservation and strong analytical and quantitative skills, as well as experience with or a strong interest in genetic lab work. Interest and ability for field work is also preferred. A Masters degree or relevant experience is preferred, but not required. Willingness to work collaboratively and advance diversity, equity and inclusivity is required. Good communication skills are also desirable. Individuals who are intellectually curious, responsible, eager to learn, team-oriented, and have attention to detail are encouraged to apply. 
 How to apply: Please send a 1) cover letter describing your qualifications, explicitly in relation to the qualifications listed above, including your commitment to fostering a welcoming and inclusive campus climate, 2) a curriculum vitae or resume, 3) unofficial transcripts, and 4) contact information for at least three references to Adrienne Kovach at adrienne.kovach@unh.edu.

Description
Three MS Graduate Research Assistantships (Fisheries Acoustics; Marine Birds & Mammals; Environmental DNA) at Cal Poly Humboldt: Baseline surveys for assessing potential impacts of offshore wind energy development off northern California

We are recruiting three MS research assistants to take part in an interdisciplinary study intended to support development of baseline information for predicting and assessing potential biological and ecological impacts of proposed floating offshore wind energy infrastructure off northern California. This project is funded by California State University’s Council on Ocean Affairs, Science, and Technology (COAST), and will center on oceanographic surveys of the coastal waters off Humboldt Bay aboard Cal Poly Humboldt’s new research vessel, the R/V North Wind.

One graduate student will be recruited to each of the three subprojects described below, joining a team of faculty researchers and collaborators to collect, curate, and analyze data and to synthesize and report findings through presentations and publications (Collaborative Efforts).  Each will develop a thesis related to the relevant subproject.

Acoustic surveys of fish and krill off northern California (Fisheries Biology, Marin Jarrin and Bjorkstedt Labs; jose.marinjarrin@humboldt.edu).  This subproject focuses on the use of scientific echosounders on the R/V North Wind to survey fish and krill distributions in relation to oceanographic and bathymetric structure, and to assess whether floating objects appear to drive aggregation behavior in fishes.  

Seabird and marine mammal distributions (Wildlife, Barton Lab; daniel.barton@humboldt.edu).   This subproject focuses on the collection of at-sea survey data, compilation with historical local data, and estimation of abundance and seasonal variation in abundance of common seabirds and marine mammals in the California North Coast region, and relating patterns of diversity and abundance to oceanographic and bathymetric structure.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) assessment of coastal fish assemblages (Fisheries Biology, Kinziger Lab; andrew.kinziger@humboldt.edu).  This subproject will implement eDNA metabarcoding approaches to characterize seasonal and spatial patterns of biodiversity in fish assemblages off northern California in relation to oceanographic and bathymetric structure.

Collaborative efforts: oceanographic context and synthesis reports Graduate research assistants will also participate in collection and development of a shared set of oceanographic data based on at-sea observations and remote sensing data products. While it is anticipated that students’ theses will yield stand-alone products and manuscripts, students will also contribute to project-wide synthesis products and presentations.


Appointment and Application Information

Appointment is contingent on admission to and enrollment in the MS program in Natural Resources at Cal Poly Humboldt for Spring 2026 (January start), in either the Fisheries Biology or Wildlife option as appropriate. Participation in project-planning activities is required by early February 2026 to prepare for initial surveys in early spring 2026. Exceptions may be considered.  Students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds are strongly encouraged to apply. 

Graduate research assistants will receive at least $17,000 per year in salary related to research activities and up to $10,000 per year in tuition/fee coverage for two years.  


Minimum qualifications include a bachelor’s degree (B.S. preferred) in a relevant field (e.g., ecology, oceanography, fisheries biology, wildlife biology, marine biology, statistics, or a closely related discipline) or equivalent post-baccalaureate education/experience; eligibility for admission to the Cal Poly Humboldt M.S. in Natural Resources (see the Natural Resources M.S. admissions information: Natural Resources, M.S. Application Information | Cal Poly Humboldt), and demonstrated competencies in (i) quantitative analysis (e.g., R or equivalent), (ii) scientific writing (e.g., reports/manuscripts), and (iii) teamwork and field readiness for small, at-sea operations. 


Preferred qualifications include prior research experience, aligned with the relevant subproject (fisheries acoustics, marine birds & mammals, or environmental DNA), and experience with statistical programming and data analysis (e.g., R), or a demonstrated capacity to learn comparable tools (e.g., Python, MATLAB).


Applications consisting of (1) a cover letter, (2) a resume or CV (to include contact information for 3 academic or professional references), and (3) transcripts (unofficial are acceptable; official are preferred) should be sent to the contact indicated for the subproject of interest.  If available, applicants should also submit their GRE scores.  A formal application to the Graduate School will be requested if required.


For full consideration, apply by 24 October 2025; the positions will remain open until filled. Expected start: early–mid January 2026.

Description
Dr. Catrin Edgeley has funding available to support multiple Ph.D. and M.S. students interested in wildfire social science in the Department of Environment and Society at Utah State University, starting either Spring or Fall 2026. The student(s) will conduct research at the community level in Utah and other western states using survey, interview, and focus group methods to document the current landscape of community wildfire adaptation. The student(s) may work on several projects, including but not limited to the following topics:

Community adaptation strategies in socially diverse communities, including public support or opposition for fuels treatments, perspectives on regulation to encourage mitigation, and strategies for reducing the health implications of smoke from wildfire and vegetation management.
Policy implications for at-risk communities, including the impacts of state-wide bills or federal strategies to manage adjacent public lands and shifts in insurance coverage.
Community wildfire recovery, including experiences with government and non-governmental assistance, developing collaborative recovery processes, and adaptation in post-fire landscapes.
Managing post-fire environments, including how interagency collaboration does or does not emerge across jurisdictions, risk communication for cascading hazards such as post-fire debris flows or flooding, and pre-fire planning for post-fire processes.

Student-led projects within these topics are flexible and there is room for students to engage in studies that align with their interests. Funding for these positions is housed within USU start-up funds, USDA grants and agreements, and Joint Fire Science Program grants. Students will have the opportunity to partner with community leaders, land managers and researchers from other institutions, and support will be provided for disseminating findings across a range of venues and modes such as conferences and community visits.

These positions are based at Utah State University’s Logan campus. Students will receive a stipend that includes 20 hours a week as a research assistant, health insurance, and a full tuition waiver. Students have the option to apply for USU graduate programs in Environment and Society or Ecology depending on their interests and anticipated career paths. Some degree tracks also allow specializations in Climate Adaptation or the addition of graduate certificates in topics such as environmental communication and engagement or applied GIS.

Preferred qualifications
A Bachelor’s (for MS applicants) and/or Master’s (for PhD applicants) in natural resources, conservation social science, sociology, psychology, forestry, policy, or a related field.
Ability to travel and stay at various research locations within the US for several weeks at a time. 
Knowledge of or experience with a variety of social science research methods.
Working knowledge of programs and platforms such as SPSS, NVivo, Qualtrics, and/or ArcGIS Pro.
Strong written and oral communication skills, ideally with both academic and non-academic audiences.

To apply for this position, please email the following documents to catrin.edgeley@usu.edu: (1) a brief statement of interest clearly stating experience, qualifications and research interests as they relate to wildfire social science; and (2) a current C.V. or resume. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis until positions are filled, although preliminary reviews will begin on Wednesday, November 5th. Additional materials such as a writing sample and references may be requested later in the process.

Description
A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) within the USGS Climate Adaptation Science Center (CASC) network, specifically the regional North Central CASC (NC CASC) located in Boulder, Colorado. Regional CASCs support and produce science to inform on-the-ground climate adaptation planning by natural and cultural resource managers. The selected candidate can report remotely however, preference will be given to candidates located in, or willing to relocate to, Colorado. The fellowship will likely entail travel to or within the Denver metro area.

Research Project: The objectives for this fellowship are to 1) document and elucidate the core planning processes of target federal resource management agencies to inform the provision of climate adaptation science support, and 2) assess the actionability of funded projects in the NC CASC portfolio and their ability to meet management partner needs.

The regional CASCs are tasked with meeting the climate impacts and adaptation science needs of Department of the Interior bureaus and supporting their climate-related planning and decision-making efforts.

*Applications may be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A postdoctoral research opportunity is available with the Tropical Crop and Commodity Protection Research Unit within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) located in Hilo, Hawaii.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

The mission of the Tropical Crop and Commodity Protection Research Unit in Hilo, Hawaii is to develop pre and postharvest technologies and management strategies for invasive pests, and to open and maintain market access and improved quality of tropical fruit, vegetable and ornamental crops grown in the Pacific Basin. The long-term goals of our research program are to develop and protect U.S export markets for fresh tropical commodities. An emphasis is placed on expanding and diversifying agriculture and agricultural exports in Hawaii and other states by providing environmentally sound, economically viable systems, treatments, or processes that control quarantine pests, ensure product quality, and increase product value while safeguarding the agriculture of other states.

Research Project: ‘Ulu (breadfruit) has significant cultural importance to Hawaiians and is one of the original staple crops that fed the island nation for close to 1,000 years with high starch, fiber, and protein contents. ‘Ulu also has a low to moderate glycemic index when cooked and can help manage blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Today, at nearly 2,500 miles from the US mainland, Hawaii imports greater than 85% of its food. Disruption to the supply chain can have catastrophic effects as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2020, food insecurity has dramatically increased among the Islands, encouraging the expansion of stable crops and processing capabilities that support the long-term storage and distribution of processed foods derived from these staple foods.

Much of Hawaii ‘ulu supply is sold as fresh produce. Mature ‘ulu, once picked, becomes soft within 1-3 days without refrigeration; the short shelf-life reduces profit margins, generates waste, limits its distribution and export opportunities. The ‘Ulu Cooperative, a collection of small, diversified ‘ulu producers, helped develop processes to produce ‘ulu flour in 2011 to increase its potential market and maximize the yield of ‘ulu. One of the biggest hurdles, however, to the processing of many of Hawaii’s crops is the lack of industrial scale facilities. With Hawaii having the highest electricity retail price at more than double the US average, the cost of large-scale processing is prohibitive. Presently, processing of ‘ulu relies on steamers and dehydrators, which are time consuming and do not produce the most consistent quality of end products. Improved processing methods are urgently needed to overcome the bottleneck of scaling up ‘ulu production, increase market distribution, reduce waste, and foster local economies. Specific activities will include maintaining and operating food processing equipment, experimental design, and nutritional and sensory analysis. Outcomes from this project will be useful to our 'ulu growers as well as other tropical commodities that are extremely perishable and in need of better processing methods.

Learning Objectives: The participant will learn how to incorporate their scientific and technical knowledge in the field of food science with food processing engineering to improve the processing capability for both research within ARS and the stakeholders in Hawaii. The participant will get to explore the possibility of incorporating sensors, spectroscopy, imaging, and machine learning techniques into the postharvest processing workflows and/or pre-harvest evaluation of food quality and safety. The participant will have the opportunity to interact with our commercial and academic collaborators, and present their research to a wide range of audiences in engineering and food science disciplines.

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Peishih Liang (peishih.liang@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full-time.

Description
POSITION ANNOUNCEMENT: Ph.D. position in Dryland Ecosystem Dynamics at the University of Nevada Las Vegas

Are you interested in studying the environments of ecosystems in the southwestern United States? My lab has collected datasets capturing unique locations, vegetation attributes, and meteorological events in deserts, woodlands, and forests in Arizona and Nevada. I am recruiting a student who would like to use these datasets to design and carry out scientific studies focused on the meteorological, temperature, and water dynamics of dryland ecosystems. Our lab elucidates the mechanisms of ecosystem change using techniques and data sources from field sampling and experiments, remote sensing and instrumentation, and modeling. The selected student will have the opportunity to learn and assist with these techniques as part of their training.

Position summary 
 The US Geological Survey (USGS) Fort Collins Science Center is seeking a PhD-level early career ecologist to contribute to a team that synthesizes science and conducts geospatial analyses for public land management activities on western lands. The candidate will be provided with important research and training opportunities, joining an existing collaboration between USGS scientists and resource managers from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and other agencies within and outside of the Department of the Interior that seek to coproduce science and data products that inform public lands decision making. 
 The immediate focus of this position will be working with a USGS team to synthesize available data, research, analysis methods, and mitigation measures related to the potential effects of priority energy development and natural resource management activities on resources of concern in the west. We anticipate that a series of synthesis and related data and analysis products will focus on energy development, fire and fuels management, livestock grazing, and recreation topics. The candidate will work with the team to identify relevant scientific papers, reports, and datasets, summarize and synthesize key findings, conduct geospatial analyses that integrate spatial datasets, analyze potential effects on resources of concern, and identify tested actions for mitigating potential adverse effects to resources of concern. This position will also be working with the team to draft, review, edit, and publish the associated reports and other products as part of USGS Fundamental Science Practices. The position may also contribute to related projects focused on developing actionable science and data products to support decision-making on federal public lands. The candidate will work as part of a team under the direction of Dr. Sarah Carter at the USGS Fort Collins Science Center. 
 Position qualifications 
 Candidates must have completed a PhD degree in natural resources management, ecology, conservation, or a related field to be eligible for consideration. Candidates must have completed their latest graduate degree within the last 12 months to be eligible for the position. Full-time in person work at the USGS Fort Collins Science Center in Fort Collins, Colorado is preferred, but part time and remote options will also be considered. Familiarity with natural resource management issues on western public lands is strongly desired, with a focus on one or more of the following topics: energy development (including reclamation), fire, livestock grazing, recreation, and potential effects to invasive annual grasses, ungulates, soils, native vegetation, water resources, or public health. Familiarity with environmental effects analysis and the National Environmental Policy Act are also highly desirable. Applicants with experience in geospatial analysis—including use of R, Python, ArcGIS, QGIS, or other spatial analysis platforms and workflows—are especially encouraged to apply. The ability to integrate spatial data with ecological synthesis is preferred. Applicants must demonstrate excellent written and oral communication skills and a strong desire to work with natural resource managers on public land management issues in western North America. Applicants should possess strong collaboration and time-management skills. Applicants must also be U.S. citizens and undergo a background check. 
 This position will be hired as a student services contractor. Student Services Contractors participate in scientific research projects at USGS Science Centers across the US and work directly with USGS scientists to gain hands-on experience in real-world science projects, build technical and professional skills, explore potential science careers and pathways, and receive mentorship from experienced scientists (https://www.usgs.gov/youth-and-education-in-science/student-services-contractors). Candidates will need to have an active SAMS account (System for Award Management, sam.gov) prior to appointment. 

The position will be paid a competitive hourly wage based on a combination of academic background, prior experience, and the location of the position.

Position Description
The Department of Forest and Conservation Sciences (Faculty of Forestry and Environmental Stewardship, Vancouver Campus, The University of British Columbia - UBC) invites applications for a tenure-track position in Forest Ecophysiology at the Assistant or Associate Professor level, to commence on July 1, 2026 or when a suitable candidate is found. We are seeking an outstanding, emerging scholar to lead world-class research in forest ecophysiology and its connections to forest resilience, with a focus on one or more of the following study areas: tree ecophysiology; plant abiotic or biotic stress physiology; forest mortality and climate change responses; forest carbon balance; tree water relations; or nutrient use. Research may focus at the molecular, organismal, or stand level, and use observational, experimental or modelling approaches. Forest management and policy require science-based information, so it is desirable if the successful candidate has experience in conducting applied research and using results to inform management or policy decisions.
 The Faculty of Forestry (https://forestry.ubc.ca/) at UBC is one of the largest of its kind globally. Its award-winning, multidisciplinary researchers explore social-ecological systems from many perspectives, including ecosystem functioning, applied forest resource management, conservation decision-making and policy, Indigenous knowledge, and values that human societies derive from nature. The Faculty is based at the Vancouver Campus of UBC, which is located on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam).
 The position requires a PhD and a strong record of research achievements in the field. Postdoctoral experience is desirable. The successful applicant will be expected to develop an innovative, externally-funded and internationally-competitive research program, supervise graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, collaborate with faculty members, and participate in service to the department, university, and academic/scientific community. They will play a key role in teaching in the Forest Sciences, Forest Resources Management, and Natural Resources Conservation undergraduate programs at UBC, including teaching a core course in Forest Plant Biology, as well as teaching graduate students. Candidates will have a strong commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion to create a welcoming community for all, particularly those who are historically, persistently, or systemically marginalized.
 The starting salary for an Assistant Professor position at UBC is: $110,000 - $135,000/year, and for an Associate Professor is $135,000-$160,000.
 Applicants should submit the following put into one PDF:
- Cover letter that summarizes (up to 2 pages):
Your research vision and accomplishments,
How your expertise, scholarship, and planned research will integrate within the Department       of Forest and Conservation Sciences,
How you have displayed leadership through: existing or proposed research; teaching; service; community engagement; outreach; contributions to equity, diversity, and inclusion; or other relevant activities.
- Up-to-date curriculum vitae.
- Statement of research interests, accomplishments and vision, and their relevance to the position (up to 2 pages).
- Three sample publications.
- Contact information for three individuals willing to serve as references.
 Address applications to Dr. Sally Aitken, Search Chair (sally.aitken@ubc.ca). Applications will be accepted until Dec. 1st, 2025.
 Additional Information:
 UBC’s vision is to inspire people, ideas and actions for a better world. Its institutional values of excellence, integrity, respect, academic freedom, and accountability are the driving forces behind its goals to pursue excellence in research, learning and engagement to foster global citizenship and advance a sustainable and just society across British Columbia, Canada, and the world. With campuses in Vancouver and Kelowna, in the Okanagan, UBC has over 66,000 students, over $700 million in research funding, a sophisticated and deeply engaging intellectual environment and an unrivalled quality of life.

Description: The Avian Ecology Program at Archbold Biological Station is seeking four interns for at least six months to participate in the long-term demography research on the Federally Threatened Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens). Four interns will start February 2nd, with two running through July 2026 and the other two running through mid-September 2026. Interns will be mentored by Dr. Sahas Barve in a dynamic lab with three research assistants. These intern positions will primarily operate at the main station located in Venus, FL as part of the long-term (56 years) research on the demography, ecology, behavior, and conservation of Florida Scrub-Jays at Archbold Biological Station. A special feature of the internship is the ability to do an independent research project either collecting new data or leveraging the long-term Florida Scrub-Jay dataset. We are especially interested in applicants that are keen on conducting independent research during their internship. 
 Archbold Expeditions is committed to integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion principles into our organization. Archbold Expeditions is an equal opportunity employer, and, as ecologists, we know the importance of diversity and encourage individuals belonging to groups under-represented in ecology to apply. 
 Interns contribute to several aspects of this research, but their primary duties include: 
Independently searching for and monitoring nests 
Conducting monthly censuses of color-banded birds 
Daily data entry 
Habituating birds for subsequent trapping 
Conducting oak acorn surveys 
Surveying FLSJ populations at other sites 
In addition, interns may assist in collecting blood samples from jays, mapping jay territories, and helping with prescribed fires 
Interns will: 
Gain experience in the trapping, handling, and bleeding of Florida Scrub-Jays. 
Have potential to volunteer with other programs at Archbold (Education, Plant, Herpetology, Predator-Prey, Agroecology etc.) 
Participate a minimum of 20 hours per week with field projects, typically Monday – Friday, with flexible weekend work during the peak of the breeding season. Hours will vary and may exceed 20 hours per week depending on the department needs. 
Independent avian ecology research project: Outside of the required fieldwork, we encourage interns to design and implement an independent research project that fits within our program. They will train in every aspect of scientific research, from project choice, experimental design, and statistical analysis to oral and written presentations. Creating and completing an independent project will prepare interns for graduate school and/or higher-level report writing required by other agencies. Many previous interns have presented their work at international conferences, and some have even published their projects in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
 General Qualifications: 
This position is ideal for students with undergraduate degrees who may be contemplating graduate school in the fields of Ecology, Evolution, Conservation Biology, and Natural Resource Management. 
A bachelor’s degree 
Respect for others 
Field experience outside of coursework; however, we provide all required training for all interns. 
A commitment and responsibility towards the integrity of the data 
The ability and willingness to work independently in the field, as well as collaborate with a small team to meet project objectives.

Archbold's mission is to build and share the scientific knowledge needed to protect the life, lands, and waters of Florida, and beyond.  Archbold’s footprint encompasses the ancient scrub habitats of the Lake Wales Ridge; the Avon Park Air Force Range Sentinel Landscape; the vast, open ranchlands of Central Florida; and the many waterways that flow south into Lake Okeechobee and then drain to the coasts, touching the lives of millions of Floridians.  Archbold studies and protects these natural wonders as ecosystems: as complex networks shaped by measurable natural processes.  Our dozens of research sites encompass the pristine sand dunes of the Lake Wales Ridge; the ranchlands and wetlands that make up much of Central Florida; and the rivers that flow south into Lake Okeechobee and beyond. 


Today Archbold stewards a rich mosaic of natural habitats, native ecosystems, working lands, and historic buildings at Archbold Biological Station and Buck Island Ranch. The Station and the Ranch serve as the place-based crucible for our innovative science, conservation, and education programs. These draw from a long, deep history, dating back from our beginnings, founded by Richard Archbold in 1941.

Description
Lajuma Research Centre, located in the Soutpansberg Mountains of Limpopo, South Africa, provides a unique setting for long-term primate and wildlife research. The surrounding mountain forest, grasslands, and rugged terrain are home to all five South African primate species (chacma baboon, vervet monkey, samango monkey, lesser bushbaby, and thick-tailed bushbaby), which offer opportunities to study complex social behaviour and ecological adaptations.

Internship Overview
The Chacma Baboon Project at Lajuma Research Centre investigates the behaviour and feeding ecology of wild but human-habituated baboon troops in the Soutpansberg Mountains. This unique setting allows close, non-invasive observation of social dynamics, movement patterns, and dietary choices. Participants help maintain long-term monitoring by collecting field data on activity patterns, habitat use, and seasonal diet. Shorter stays focus on broad behavioural and ecological observations, while longer placements provide opportunities to pursue specific research questions under guidance from the project team.

Key Activities
Behavioural observations — recording daily activities, social interactions, dominance hierarchies, and group movements.
Feeding ecology studies — identifying plant species consumed, collecting and analysing feeding remains and foraging data.
Habitat use mapping — tracking troop ranging patterns and habitat preferences with GPS and field mapping.
Long-term data management — contributing to existing baboon databases, updating group composition and individual identifications.
Field skills development — learning navigation in mountainous terrain, safe wildlife observation, and ecological survey methods.

Requirements
No prior field experience is needed; field training is included in the internship.
Open to students, recent graduates, or individuals interested in primatology, animal behaviour, or conservation.
Ability to hike long distances over rugged terrain.
Comfortable working in variable weather conditions and remote environments.

Duration
Flexible, with a minimum stay of 8 weeks recommended. For projects of greater depth, a commitment of 3-6 months or more is encouraged.

Conservation Fee
The fee supports ongoing research and conservation at Lajuma. It also includes shared accommodation, transport to/from Louis Trichardt, and biweekly town trips for supplies.

Description
 *Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), located in Beltsville, Maryland.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: The project centers on exploring the challenges of managing plant diseases caused by phytoplasma and spiroplasma infections, with the aim of finding effective solutions. The bacteria lack cell walls and can penetrate plant phloem sieve cells, leading to serious diseases in key crops such as citrus and corn. Early diagnosis and sensitive pathogen detection are needed for successful disease management. Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will have the opportunity to conduct research that seeks to identify molecular and physiological markers that can improve early detection of phytoplasmas, ultimately helping to reduce phytoplasma-related diseases.

Learning Objectives: Under the guidance of a mentor, the fellow will have the opportunity to:

Gain insights into the unique genomic and pathological features of phytoplasmas and spiroplasmas;
Explore the physiological signals and gene pathways that regulate phytoplasma virulence and plant defense; and
Select and evaluate appropriate molecular markers for detecting phytoplasmas and spiroplasmas during the early stages of the disease.
Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Wei Wei (wei.wei@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: September 2025. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $45,000 - $85,000 annually.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Questions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process, please email ORISE.ARS.Northeast@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.

Minimum Qualifications:

To be successful in this role, you’ll need a bachelor’s degree and at least four years of progressively responsible experience in a related field—or an equivalent mix of training and experience that demonstrates your ability to do the job.

Description: The Oklahoma Cooperative Fish & Wildlife Research Unit at Oklahoma State University is looking to hire (3) seasonal technicians and (1) crew lead to assist with camera and fecal surveys for prairie gray fox in eastern Oklahoma. The prairie gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus ocythous) was petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act due to concerns over perceived declines in abundance and distribution. Field work will support research on prairie gray fox in Oklahoma to aid managers and inform the status review.

·       Fantastic interpersonal, communication and organizational skills
·       Field experience with wildlife surveys (>12 months)
·       Ability to solve problems in the field
·       Excellent time management skills (especially as it pertains to helping create and abide by a field schedule taking into account weather conditions, distance between sites, etc.)

Description: The Oklahoma Cooperative Fish & Wildlife Research Unit at Oklahoma State University is looking to hire (3) seasonal technicians and (1) crew lead to assist with camera and fecal surveys for prairie gray fox in eastern Oklahoma. The prairie gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus ocythous) was petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act due to concerns over perceived declines in abundance and distribution. Field work will support research on prairie gray fox in Oklahoma to aid managers and inform the status review. Technicians and crew lead will work closely with the PhD student on the project to deploy game cameras and collect biological samples across much of eastern Oklahoma. 
 Candidates must be willing and able to hike long distances (up to 20 km a day), over difficult terrain (e.g., thick vegetation, poison ivy, briars) in potentially extreme conditions (e.g., both cold winter conditions and warm spring temperatures and humidity). Candidates must also be comfortable with having limited connectivity (i.e., internet or cellular service) and be comfortable sharing accommodation with other technicians (potentially co-ed). Lodging and field vehicles will be provided. Due to the large sampling area, housing will vary throughout the season and may include rental houses/cabins, hotels/motels, camper trailers, or camping. Consequently, technicians must be flexible, prepared to move throughout the field season, and willing to camp for short periods of time. Finally, work will mostly take place in teams (groups of two), therefore the ability to work cohesively in small teams safely with minimal supervision is a must.

Description
Institutional Mission:  

The School for Field Studies (SFS) creates transformative study abroad experiences through field-based learning and research. Our educational programs explore the human and ecological dimensions of the complex environmental problems faced by our local partners, contributing to sustainable solutions in the places where we live and work. The SFS community is part of a growing network of individuals and institutions committed to environmental stewardship.

Location:  

Siem Reap, Cambodia     

Start Date:
January 5th, 2026 

Position Summary:  

The SFS Center for Environmental Justice and Mekong Ecologies, located in Siem Reap, Cambodia, seeks an enthusiastic, team-oriented individual to serve as part of a team of faculty and staff that delivers an interdisciplinary, hands-on learning experience to students spending a semester in Cambodia. On a contract basis, the Lecturer in Freshwater Ecology will deliver the 50-hour Freshwater Ecology course during the fall and spring semesters. Additionally, during fall and spring, they will co-teach the 50-hour Directed Research course with other faculty members, leading a faculty-developed directed research project with a small group of students.  

SFS programs are field-based and experiential. This position will engage students in a classroom and through extensive time spent in the field. We encourage faculty to integrate as much fieldwork and hands-on experience into their courses as possible.  

SFS programs do not follow a nine to five model. Faculty are also integral members of the Center’s communal living model, eating and working with the student cohort.   

Faculty are expected to be active members in the community-building process. Additional responsibilities outside of teaching may include participation in community engagement days, involvement in student life, organization of laboratory space, and general Center upkeep. We are especially interested in candidates with experience teaching to a diverse student body, and demonstrated commitment to diversity, inclusion, and cultural competence in a learning environment, conservation, and the Center’s host community.   

Center Focus: 
The SFS Center for Environmental Justice and Mekong Ecologies seeks to understand both the conflicts and synergies of conservation and development. Students gain a sense of the richness of the greater Mekong region—biodiversity, social and cultural diversity, and ecosystem services—while exploring strategies for sustainable livelihoods within Cambodia, a highly productive and diverse country in Southeast Asia.  

The interdisciplinary themes of natural sciences, socio-ecological resilience, environmental ethics and justice, and conservation guide our inquiry. Through coursework, field exercises, and Directed Research, students study people’s dependence on the environment, examine various threats to the environment and to livelihood resilience, and explore the tools and strategies for mitigating the threats and promoting well-being among rural communities. 

Minimum Qualifications:

Ph.D. and university-level teaching experience in freshwater or aquatic ecology, environmental science, conservation biology, or related fields. Candidates with a Master’s degree and significant scholarship may be considered. 

Fluency in English (all courses taught in English) 

Field research experience, preferably in the fields of freshwater ecology, conservation biology, natural resource management, or related fields. 

Strong skills in quantitative research methods 

Extensive knowledge and experience in statistical analysis 

Demonstrated commitment to creating inclusive learning environments 

Demonstrated ability to work as part of an interdisciplinary teaching and research team 

Track record of research publications 

Demonstrated commitment to environmental issues 


Preferred Qualifications: 

Candidates with pre-existing work authorization for Cambodia and/or are a Cambodian national are preferred     

Experience working in SE Asia, particularly Cambodia

Experience teaching field courses 

Experience with residential student group management and/or risk management 

Fluency or proficiency in Khmer 

Experience cross-teaching or collaborating on projects in conservation biology, natural resource management, or interdisciplinary environmental studies with a focus on human–environment interactions 

Able to operate standard transmission vehicles (driving license may be required) 

Track record of grant writing success 

Current First Aid, CPR, and/or Wilderness First Aid certification 

Course Descriptions: 

Freshwater Ecology: This course introduces students to the freshwater ecology of Cambodia’s Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake, one of the world’s most interesting flood-pulse ecosystems. Students investigate key ecological processes such as primary productivity, nutrient cycling, food webs, and species interactions in river–lake systems shaped by seasonal hydrology. Hands-on training includes fish morphology and assemblage identification, water quality sampling, species surveys, and biodiversity indices to assess ecosystem health. To complement ecological fieldwork, students conduct interviews and stakeholder analyses to explore how fishing livelihoods, agricultural expansion, and resource use intersect with water quality and ecosystem dynamics. Through this integrated lens, students develop a deeper understanding of the ecological and human dimensions that sustain and challenge Cambodia’s freshwater systems. 

Directed Research: This course provides students with the opportunity to apply ecological, biological, and/or social-scientific methods to a field research project that addresses a local issue related to the environment. We will also investigate the ways that various methods and theories distinguish (or don’t) fact from interpretation, cause from correlation, and advocacy from objectivity. The directed research topics are derived from the SFS Center’s Research Plan as defined by the Center staff and local stakeholders. Through the Directed Research project, students will contribute to a growing body of scientific research that informs local conservation and resource management decisions. SFS program lecturers lead a small group of students in this research component of the program.
