*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNWRS) located in Wenatchee, Washington.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: This project will evaluate smoke emissions over a broad range of fuel, fuel moisture, and meteorological conditions and prescribed, cultural, and wildfire burn events. Using available software platforms, smoke emission factors and total smoke production by factor will be accounted for and differenced for the range of burn conditions as above. This research will involve a collaborative process with Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forests and create geospatial tools for wildfire, prescribed burning, and cultural burning related smoke trade-off analyses and quantitative forest landscape restoration and decision support. Results and findings will be submitted to one or more leading peer-reviewed journals, and presentations will be provided to Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest and other partners, along with the databases we create. The geospatial smoke tradeoffs dataset can then be used in project planning.

Learning Objectives: The fellow will develop professionally while engaging in research-operational partnerships and learning about systems involving forest fuels and fire emissions modeling. They will gain experience with modeling, coding, and database management in support of a complex, multi-model ecological forecasting workflow. The fellow will gain valuable experience in advanced model development, calibration, and synthesis of the forest succession, fire severity, and climate change components of this workflow. The fellow will collaborate at the USDA Forest Service, Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest and will have the opportunity to improve professional collaboration and communication skills.

Mentor: The mentors for this opportunity are Brion Salter (robert.salter@usda.gov) and Dr. Paul Hessburg (paul.hessburg@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: As soon as possible, however onboarding may not start until September. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $60,000.00 – $75,000.00 Yearly.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) only.

Description
The UCLA La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science invites applications for its 2026 Postdoctoral Fellowship in California Conservation Science. We seek to hire one or more postdoctoral scholars who conduct innovative biological research at the interface of applied and basic science. Our long-term goal is to help fund a cadre of innovative young scientists who will work closely with UCLA faculty, help broaden the mission of conservation science for the campus, and lead to long-term collaborations between our academic scientists and applied conservation practitioners that will direct and lead California conservation efforts.

Candidates may work in any discipline that provides the scientific underpinnings for the preservation, protection, management, or restoration of at-risk species, environments, or ecological communities in California. Current and past La Kretz Postdocs have worked on a wide variety of research topics, ranging from urban biodiversity and evolutionary adaptation, to wildfire management and conservation, to the interface of conservation and animal behavior; we are open to work in any California ecosystem or group of organisms, as long as the research is innovative, creative, and has clear practical significance. An important initiative, the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP), is a large, multi-campus initiative led by the La Kretz Center that is delivering genomic resources to California decision-makers to enhance species and habitat management, and candidates may seek to build off of that project in the realm of conservation genomics. For a full description of past fellows and their work, please visit us at https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/lakretz/

Fellows must have both an on-campus UCLA mentor, and an off-campus, non-university mentor. The on-campus UCLA mentor must also be a La Kretz Center affiliate. A list of applicable affiliates is available at https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/lakretz/people/. 

The Fellow is expected to work closely with their identified UCLA mentor and one or more off-campus agency partner(s) in developing their project. All applications should include a letter (which may be brief) from each mentor stating their support for the project, what they can contribute to it, and how it fits into their work in conservation biology. Applications that do not include these letters of support will be considered incomplete and ineligible for consideration, and we strongly advise candidates to secure mentor support as early as possible. While we encourage project proponents to identify co-funding, from mentors or other agencies, co-funding is not a requirement. Off-campus mentors may be drawn from any California agency or NGO, including federal and state groups. A partial list of some of our active partners and contact people includes:

The Nature Conservancy: Sophie Parker (restoration; urban conservation; invasive species)
Note: TNC has been a particularly active partner and cofunder in recent years, and we encourage applicants working with TNC mentors to consult : https://tnc.box.com/s/uetrddu6sncp3nipgn8a1hh6fi3jisgi
LA Natural History Museum: Jann Vendetti (mollusk ecology and evolution; species natural history)

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNWRS) located in Wenatchee, Washington.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: The PNWRS Lab in Wenatchee, Washington has a six-decade history of collaborating with eastern WA National Forests to develop geospatial scripts and tools that characterize forest vegetation conditions and changes occurring over the 20th and 21st centuries and expected changes in conditions and disturbance processes over 21st century. Together the Forests and the Lab also build decision support tools that support a Forest-wide strategies to create healthy and wildfire adapted forests and a toolkit for evaluating current conditions and adapting them to wildfires and warming.

This project creates updates in a landscape evaluation toolkit, which include new models for listed and sensitive species. These models can inform managers during planning on how to improve forest health and reduce adverse consequences to sensitive species. Revisions also include updating values in the existing models that reflect new science and lessons learned over the last 15-years. The toolkit also includes evaluation tools that show current wildfire risk, overly dense forest conditions, and opportunities for transitioning forest conditions that are adapted to 21st century wildfires and drying environmental conditions through management.

Learning Objectives: The fellow will develop professionally while engaging in research-operational partnerships and learning about systems involving forest composition, structure, insect and disease vulnerability, and fuels and fire emissions. They will gain experience with modeling, coding, and database management in support of a complex workflow. The fellow will gain valuable experience in decision support science while improving existing tools. The fellow will collaborate with others at the USDA Forest Service, Okanagan-Wenatchee National Forest and will have the opportunity to improve professional collaboration and communication skills.

Mentor: The mentors for this opportunity are Brion Salter (robert.salter@usda.gov) and Dr. Paul Hessburg (paul.hessburg@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Description
 Description

The Great Basin Institute will recruit and support an Administrative Historian who will complete a new administrative history for John Day Fossil Beds National Monument (JODA). The historian at JODA will engage in researching and writing a comprehensive history of how JODA has been managed from 1996 to the present day, including important issues in planning, land acquisition, development, public relations, and other topics of ongoing management concern. The final narrative reference will consist of a scholarly examination of the administrative history of the unit and will serve as a valuable tool for future park managers and scholars. The research effort resulting from this project will significantly expand the site’s reference and archival files and provide additional information for park staff. Finally, the administrative history will be placed on JODA’s website to make the information widely available to the public.
A chronology of land acquisitions, paleontology research, archaeology surveys, park developments, special programs, resource protection and mitigation, and personnel changes are necessary to conduct many aspects of everyday park operations as well as in preparation for the Park’s 50-year anniversary in 2025. There has been a high degree of turnover at the Park recently. As such, there has been a great deal of loss of institutional memory. Having a new administrative history will help capture institutional knowledge and prevent further loss. The historian will create a published scholarly, and comprehensively updated report bridging the gap between the last administrative history report, in 1996, and the present. This report will be a substantial aid in the documentation of the history of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.
Description:
The updated administrative history will include photos and graphics as well as a comprehensive assessment of primary and secondary sources in local, regional, state and national archives.  Oral history interviews will be conducted with present and former NPS staff, park partners, volunteers and others. These interviews will require travel to meet individuals both within the commuting distance of the park and outside of it. The study will be prepared by a professional historian who meets the Secretary of the Interior’s standards for historians and follows the guidelines outlined in Director’s Order 28.
Project Objectives:
This project will result in a published scholarly, and comprehensively updated report bridging the gap between the 1996 report and the present and will be a substantial aid in the documentation of the history of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. This historic report will research and document cultural resources of the park from 1996 to present and is a baseline document. As appropriate, data from this research and the archive of the 1997 administrative history will be added to the park archives and entered into MCMS, and copies of the finished product will be added to the park’s library as well as disseminated to other appropriate areas. A PDF copy will also be made available through the IRMA database for wider access.
Project milestones include review of previous Administrative History, interviews with current JODA staff, identifying former JODA staff to interview and pertinent oral history questions to ask, gathering of archival data, and the synthesis of the final report. The historian will have monthly meetings with the JODA site supervisor to evaluate progress.
Location:
John Day Fossil Beds NM is situated in the John Day River Valley and surrounding lands. There are three separate units (Sheep Rock, Clarno, and Painted Hills) which are between one and two-hour drives away from each other. The area of paleontological interest consists of over 10,000 square miles cooperatively managed by the NPS, BLM, and USFS. Elevation in the region varies from 1,500 feet to 9,000 feet. Vegetation includes sagebrush/bunchgrass steppe, junipers, and forests of firs, ponderosas, and aspens. Weather in summer tends to be hot and dry with little precipitation and high temperatures regularly exceeding 100 degrees F. The area is remote and rural, with several nearby towns (population <200 people) and more distant towns of several thousand. Limited grocery shopping options are available in smaller towns near the monument (~10 miles distant), but the nearest grocery store, pharmacy, and hospital are about 45 miles from park headquarters (Sheep Rock Unit). More facilities and services are available in the Bend area which is about 120 miles from the Sheep Rock Unit. The closest airport is in Redmond, OR, about two-hour drive from the Sheep Rock Unit. Other airports are in Boise, ID, Pasco, WA, and Portland, OR.

Archbold will not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on any of these characteristics and stands proud of its collaborative culture. 


Archbold's mission is to build and share the scientific knowledge needed to protect the life, lands, and waters of Florida, and beyond.  Archbold’s footprint encompasses the ancient scrub habitats of the Lake Wales Ridge; the Avon Park Air Force Range Sentinel Landscape; the vast, open ranchlands of Central Florida; and the many waterways that flow south into Lake Okeechobee and then drain to the coasts, touching the lives of millions of Floridians.  Archbold studies and protects these natural wonders as ecosystems: as complex networks shaped by measurable natural processes.  Our dozens of research sites encompass the pristine sand dunes of the Lake Wales Ridge; the ranchlands and wetlands that make up much of Central Florida; and the rivers that flow south into Lake Okeechobee and beyond. 


Today Archbold stewards a rich mosaic of natural habitats, native ecosystems, working lands, and historic buildings at Archbold Biological Station and Buck Island Ranch. The Station and the Ranch serve as the place-based crucible for our innovative science, conservation, and education programs. These draw from a long, deep history, dating back from our beginnings, founded by Richard Archbold in 1941.

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Southwest Research Station (PSWRS). This project is based at three long-term ecohydrological research sites (Soaproot, Newt Creek, and Providence), which are managed by the PSWRS of the USDA FS in the Sierra Nevada.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: The participant will engage in field-based research examining the impacts of wildfire and drought-induced tree mortality on water quality and quantity in headwater forest ecosystems.

The participant will collect water and gas samples from boreholes, soils, and streams, with a focus on capturing spatiotemporal variation in hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to disturbance. Specific activities will include participating in field campaigns to monitor moisture dynamics, collecting and analyzing water samples for major ions, nutrients, water stable isotopes, and carbon isotopes, and assisting in the maintenance and calibration of field instrumentation.

Laboratory activities will involve preparing and analyzing samples using techniques such as ion chromatography and isotope ratio spectroscopy. The participant will collaborate closely with graduate students and project collaborators to synthesize results, compare site responses, and contribute to research on how forest structure and climate extremes shape water availability and watershed function.

Learning Objectives: This opportunity will provide training in hydrologic instrumentation, sample analysis, and environmental data interpretation, supporting the agency’s mission to advance science-based forest and water resource management.

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is David Dralle (david.dralle@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for 3 months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $16,251.10 monthly.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Questions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email ORISE.USFS.PSWRS@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.

Qualifications
The qualified candidate should be a faculty member at a US institution and returning to the University at the completion of the appointment.

Description

Global Life-history, Ornithology & Behavioural Ecology (GLOBE) research group (https://GLOBEresearchgroup.com – new webpages under construction will be launched soon) focuses on ecology, behaviour, life-history strategies and population dynamics of wild animals, particularly birds, including impacts and consequences of recent environmental changes. The GLOBE research group, led by Vojtěch Kubelka from Department of Zoology and Centre for Polar Ecology at the Faculty of Sciences, University of South Bohemia in the Czech republic, has been recently awarded a prestigious ERC CZ grant: Animal migrations in a changing world – still advantageous strategy or maladaptive behaviour? for five years till 2029.


Animal migrations represent one of the greatest spectacles in nature, providing crucial ecosystem services as well as resources for human communities. Why do animals migrate? It has been thought that animals migrate to reproduce at higher latitudes, taking advantage of lower predation pressure, fewer parasites and seasonally high pulses in food supply. However, it has been highlighted that recent climate change and human pressure impacts can erode such benefits and migratory animals are declining globally with poorly understood underlying mechanisms.


We strive to tackle pressing issues: Are there still latitudinal gradients in predation, parasitism and seasonal food availability, supporting the benefits of migratory behaviour? How are migratory animals able to cope with environmental changes? What are the most important drivers and life stages limiting populations of migratory animals? To achieve this, we are executing comprehensive research of migration profitability, combining experimental, observational and comparative approaches – investigating latitudinal gradients in predation, parasites, food supply and whole life-cycles of tracked shorebirds, a suitable model taxon with intra-specific variability in migratory strategies and exposed ground nests – at 16 study sites from the Arctic to Patagonia.


We seek to appoint an early career scientist as post-doctoral researcher to contribute to this new project.


What would be your main responsibilities

Organize and conduct ornithological field work at selected study sites across Western Palearctic and South America in association with international collaborators
Combine experimental and observational fieldwork with a comparative approach based on extracting relevant information from published literature
Coordinate data collection and analyses, working with large datasets in relational databases
Prepare and write manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals
Lead or participate in funding applications for research in collaboration with team members
Supervise students and research assistants
Participate in conservation activities
Present and promote the results at conferences and seminars
Disseminate the project outputs to stakeholders and public,
Carry out other scientific and/or academic activities that are important for the success of the project

What we offer

A two-year position with the possibility of extension based on the performance
Excellent instruments, equipment and multiple research platforms within the Faculty of Sciences, University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice, Czech Republic
Access to the Czech Arctic research station at Svalbard and fieldwork at study sites along latitudinal gradients from Morocco to Arctic and from tropical South America to Patagonia
Extensive international networking and mentoring opportunities
Full logistical support for own follow-up research funding applications
English speaking, stimulating & friendly international research environment
HR Award certificate, jcu.cz/about-the-university/development/hr-award-hrs4r
Professional administration support and assistance with all personal, economic, legal, project, IT, intellectual property needs, flexible working time
Competitive salary + possible bonuses, 5 weeks of paid vacation per year
Meals allowance, special mobile services, university kindergarten
Work-life balance in a historical middle-sized university city, cz/en/

Competitive candidates are expected to have

PhD in evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology, zoology, or relevant field of life sciences
A foundation of knowledge in two or more fields: evolutionary ecology, climate change biology, demography and population dynamics, predator-prey interactions and animal migration
Experience in conducting or supervising international research projects

Description:

The Great Basin Institute, in cooperation with the USFS, is recruiting a Sr Archaeology Crew Lead to complete Section 106 cultural resource surveys, site recording and monitoring for various projects within the Fremont-Winema National Forest.

 Position Description: 

Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial (LIBO) is seeking two interns to assist with youth and family program development as well as bilingual education and interpretation initiatives. These programs and products will be designed for use at the park site and within the surrounding community.

In 2017 and 2018, Latino Heritage Interns at LIBO collaborated with the Association of Latino Americans in Southern Indiana (ALASI) to establish ""Fiesta in the Park,"" an event hosted on LIBO park grounds. This event aimed to strengthen connections between the park and an underserved community in the area. While these relationships were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic, LIBO is eager to reconnect with this audience.

In 2023 and 2024, LHIP interns expanded on the earlier successes by creating public programs for local festivals, libraries, and summer camps. These efforts also included forming partnerships with community organizations such as ALASI and Carnival Latino. With 29% of the population of Huntingburg, Indiana (approximately 11 miles north of the park) identifying as Hispanic or Latino, LIBO’s 2025 interns will focus on developing audience-centered experiences primarily geared toward Spanish speakers and updating the park's educational and interpretive materials.

Potential Programs:

Exploring Southern Indiana nature.

Learning about pioneer life and Abraham Lincoln’s time in Southern Indiana.

Providing on-site living history farm tours and Visitor Center exploration activities.

Community Engagement:
Throughout the summer, interns will work to:

Conduct outreach with the Latinx community, particularly in the Huntingburg area.

Expand existing programs.

Re-establish connections with local Latinx audiences.

Hosting LHIP interns in 2025 is a critical step in LIBO’s effort to create continuity in its outreach initiatives with the local Latinx community.

 

Qualifications: 

 Education Background:

Fields of study: History, Education, Earth Sciences, Communications.

Skills and Attributes:

Fluent in English and Spanish (speaking, reading, and writing).

You must be a U.S. citizen or legal resident.

A drivers license is required for this position.

*A personal vehicle is preferred for this position.

 

Position Description: 


The LHIP intern will contribute to the National Park Service (NPS) and Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area’s (DEWA) mission by providing resource-based recreation, education, and enjoyment near the most densely populated region of the nation. The intern will have three central projects while serving at DEWA.

Bilingual Public Programs:
The first project is to build upon previous programmatic and community engagement successes by providing at least four bilingual public programs throughout the summer. A fluent Spanish-speaking visitor services presence is a significant need at the park and would greatly increase outreach to Latino visitors. DEWA staff have developed and initiated a very popular waterfall walk along an accessible trail, which would be an excellent opportunity for the intern to present to Spanish-speaking groups. Topics may include watersheds, migrations, adaptations, forest forensics, and more!

Translating Park Publications:
The second project for the Latino Heritage Intern would be to translate park publications and maps from English to Spanish. This would allow park rangers who are not bilingual to provide Spanish-speaking visitors with appropriate information for a safe and enjoyable visit.

River and Beach Access Sites:
The third project is to improve access to popular river and beach sites within the park by providing orientation, water safety information, and audience-centered interpretation to groups. The intern will be given time and support to develop pop-up programs, beach programs, and/or an introductory Spanish-language Junior Ranger Program to engage families in lessons and activities about river safety. (Over the past three years, there have been five visitor drownings at DEWA, with 40% of the victims speaking Spanish as their first language.)

Additionally, DEWA is partnering with Latino Outdoors, Outdoor Afro, and NPCA to provide guided hikes. The Latino Heritage Intern would prepare for the hikes with the park’s supervisory ranger and have the opportunity to coordinate, lead, and strengthen visitor relationships with resources and recreational opportunities. Interns will also collaborate with seasonal employees, partners, volunteers, and supervisory staff to attend community programs and outreach events with the goal of reaching Spanish-speaking visitors.

 

Responsibilities:

 Fluency in Spanish
Interest in embracing new opportunities
Willingness to develop and build self-awareness
 

Qualifications:

Educational/Experience Requirements:

At least two years of coursework toward a degree in biological sciences or two years of field experience related to natural resource/vegetation work
One semester of coursework related to geospatial data
Clearance:

Government security background clearance required before starting
Work Abilities:

Ability to work productively both independently and as part of a team
Effective communication with team members, agency staff, and a diverse public
Physical ability to:
Hike up to 10 miles daily on uneven terrain with a pack
Work in harsh and rapidly changing environments
Traverse uneven terrain and carry up to 40 pounds in a backpack
Maintain good physical condition
Fieldwork Requirements:

Willingness to spend multiple days camping in the field, as needed
Organizational Skills:

Strong organizational abilities

Description
Stations: Toucan Ridge Ecology and Education Society (T.R.E.E.S) 
Location: 27.5 miles Hummingbird Highway, Stann Creek 
Country: Belize, Central America 
 Description: 
The T.R.E.E.S Farm has been established as a Farm-to-Table organic operation and regenerative agriculture demonstration farm. Its primary purpose is to serve the original needs of the NGO’s operations which are wildlife conservation through research and education. This is accomplished through the layout of the farm which provides extensive wildlife habitat and foraging opportunities, increasing the local faunal biodiversity as well as acting as an educational demonstration to local subsistence farmers and visiting students.  
Interns will learn by assisting in implementation and evaluation of management practices, cropping, and record keeping on the farm with this vision in mind while we endeavor to maximize the products coming from the farm with the existing design and layout using sustainable and regenerative practices specific to the Mesoamerican uplands. Within this broad framework, intern projects can include several basic Agricultural Education disciplines including Tropical Agriculture, Sustainable/organic Agriculture, Farm Management, Waste management, and Agricultural Economics.  
In addition to planting crops, we also have free range chickens and ducks for eggs and meat. We are looking to increase our revenue generation from the farm either in the form of increased accountable products entering our kitchen for use in our restaurant, or for sale to the Mobile Market or in a proposed road-side café which would be managed by T.R.E.E.S kitchen and hospitality staff. Thus, interns would also assist us with marketing strategy for existing products and/or planting. 
By the successful conclusion of this internship, the student will be able to apply practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species, basic free range poultry operations, evaluate different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns, and become familiar with sustainable management practices such as no/low till, cover cropping, waste management, mulching, marketing, Farm-to-Table, etc. 
 Requirements: 
No prior tropical agriculture experience required. Interns can be current undergraduate or graduate students enrolled in a program with their University/College for credit however non-students can also apply; but preference will be given to students enrolled in an accreditation program. Experienced tropical agriculturalists and/or agroforestry professionals are also welcome and will be treated according to their experience level and are eligible for *discounted rates. 
 Internship Responsibilities: 
Applying practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species and basic free range poultry operations. 
Evaluating different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns. 
Work on Inga Alley-cropping and other regenerative cropping practices, and using intercropping, organic fertilizing and pest control practices. 
Assist with innovative marketing strategies for existing products accompanied by reviewing projected budgets for the farm and their products and exploring cost/profit ratios for poultry husbandry. 
Planting and selling new products for the farm. 
Opportunities are also available to observe and participate with concurrent intern and wildlife educational activities such as mist-netting, observing and recording measurements of bats, birds, herps, invertebrates, water quality, and much more. 
Interns will assist with creating captions for social media posts to engage and update followers on what has been going on at the field station and various projects that are being done. 
 Internship Period: 
Interns can choose to do a minimum of 2 weeks to a maximum of 5 weeks during this Apprenticeship program, though 4 weeks is the recommended duration. 
 Costs: 
This internship has a fee of $184 USD/week which includes room and board (meals included Monday-Friday), full access to lab equipment, and training by professional on-site biologists. Food is not provided as part of the internship program. Interns can also purchase their own basic food supplies from nearby vendors that can be prepared simply on-site without access to a full kitchen OR interns can order meals from the on-site Toucan Café restaurant that is open daily and caters to all dietary restrictions Lodging at the research center signifies a shared dormitory-style rustic cabins with other same sex interns with full access to other facilities such as showers, restrooms, and kitchen.

Working Conditions: 

Work setting, including hazards: Field: The incumbent will assist with the collection of fish or invertebrates from boats and along the Puget Sound shoreline. This may include living on a boat for up to a week at a time. The incumbent will be subjected to inclement weather, including rough seas that may induce motion sickness. Shoreline sampling of mussels may occur along rocky and muddy shorelines at night in remote areas. The incumbent may lift heavy objects such as ice-filled coolers and baskets of fish on the deck of a moving boat. Fish handled by staff may possess sharp and venomous spines and may bite. The incumbent will assist with deploying and retrieving sampling nets from a boat or shore. This position may involve working in or near water, including tasks that require navigating, negotiating, and performing duties related to water environments.

Lab: Work will involve sitting or standing at a lab bench while performing repetitive, sometimes tedious dissections of fish and invertebrates for long periods of time. Dissections and sample creation may occur in a mobile laboratory set up on a boat or an off-site location but mostly will occur at the NRB Marine Resources Lab.

  Emergency Response – APHIS is an emergency response agency.  This means that all Agency employees may be asked or assigned to participate in rotating temporary duty assignments to support emergency programs at some time during their careers with APHIS.  It is difficult to predict the frequency with which such emergency situations may occur – and could range from several emergencies in a year to none over the course of many years.  In the event that you are called upon to support an emergency program, this may require irregular working hours, including overtime, and may include duties other than those specified in your official position description.  While some emergency program support assignments may be able to be performed at the employee’s current duty station, in other cases employees may be asked to go on-site to a temporary duty state location.  In addition, it may be necessary for employees to participate in multiple rotations to an emergency program assignment.  Attempts will be made to keep disruption to the employee to a minimum.
