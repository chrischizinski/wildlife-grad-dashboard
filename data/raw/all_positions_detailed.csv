Description
The UCLA La Kretz Center for California Conservation Science invites applications for its 2026 Postdoctoral Fellowship in California Conservation Science. We seek to hire one or more postdoctoral scholars who conduct innovative biological research at the interface of applied and basic science. Our long-term goal is to help fund a cadre of innovative young scientists who will work closely with UCLA faculty, help broaden the mission of conservation science for the campus, and lead to long-term collaborations between our academic scientists and applied conservation practitioners that will direct and lead California conservation efforts.

Candidates may work in any discipline that provides the scientific underpinnings for the preservation, protection, management, or restoration of at-risk species, environments, or ecological communities in California. Current and past La Kretz Postdocs have worked on a wide variety of research topics, ranging from urban biodiversity and evolutionary adaptation, to wildfire management and conservation, to the interface of conservation and animal behavior; we are open to work in any California ecosystem or group of organisms, as long as the research is innovative, creative, and has clear practical significance. An important initiative, the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP), is a large, multi-campus initiative led by the La Kretz Center that is delivering genomic resources to California decision-makers to enhance species and habitat management, and candidates may seek to build off of that project in the realm of conservation genomics. For a full description of past fellows and their work, please visit us at https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/lakretz/

Fellows must have both an on-campus UCLA mentor, and an off-campus, non-university mentor. The on-campus UCLA mentor must also be a La Kretz Center affiliate. A list of applicable affiliates is available at https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/lakretz/people/. 

The Fellow is expected to work closely with their identified UCLA mentor and one or more off-campus agency partner(s) in developing their project. All applications should include a letter (which may be brief) from each mentor stating their support for the project, what they can contribute to it, and how it fits into their work in conservation biology. Applications that do not include these letters of support will be considered incomplete and ineligible for consideration, and we strongly advise candidates to secure mentor support as early as possible.

Description
 *Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

NOAA Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS), Stressor Detection and Impacts Division (SDI), Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) Forecasting Branch located in Kodiak, Alaska. The opportunity is located in Kodiak, Alaska.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) formed the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) in 1999 as the focal point for NOAA’s coastal ocean science efforts. NCCOS uses cutting-edge research and high-tech instrumentation to provide citizens, coastal managers, public health officials, and other decision makers with reliable information needed to determine how best to protect environmental resources and public health, preserve valued habitats, and improve the way communities interact with coastal ecosystems. The NCCOS is headquartered in Silver Spring, MD but also has research labs across the nation. The NCCOS also has many assets including research programs, vessels, satellites, science centers, laboratories, and a vast pool of distinguished scientists and experts.

The HAB-F Branch delivers near real-time forecasting products for predicting the intensity/severity, location, and the potential health risk HABs pose in the Great Lakes and coastal regions of the U.S. While national in scope, forecasting efforts and products address regional needs and specific HAB species. The product sets are intended to support coastal resource managers, public health officials, researchers, and the public.

Research Project: Under the guidance of a technical mentor, the selected participant will gain experience in various research activities including performing and otherwise supporting collection of field data, including use of oceanographic monitoring instruments, collection of water, sediment and/or tissue samples and other activities. As well as conducting laboratory studies including toxin analysis, microscopy, molecular methods development and validation, and data analytics. This opportunity will also include engagement with, and training of, stakeholders in Alaska as well as generating outreach materials and technical documentation.

The specific project includes supporting ongoing research efforts in Alaska in support of HAB forecast development. Alaska experiences annual blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella, as well as other HAB species that can cause shellfish toxicity and vector toxins through the marine food web. There is a need for better monitoring and HAB forecasting products to help mitigate these blooms but much of Alaska is lacking in environmental monitoring data to support a HAB forecasting effort. The overarching goal of this project is to learn about data collection for HAB monitoring, and to help support forecasting data collection to mitigate the impacts of such blooms. This will involve collaborating with a variety of NOAA partners and interacting with stakeholders to support data collection from water, plankton and other biota, collection of environmental data with oceanographic sensors, and supporting laboratory processing of samples for analysis.

Description
Mountain ecosystems are among the regions most susceptible to temperature warming, and species adapted to alpine ecosystems are predicted to face local extinctions via physiological and/or behavioral intolerance to rapid increases in temperature. Persistence of alpine avifauna will depend upon the ability of individuals to seek out microhabitats that provide cool refugia while engaging in behaviors that reduce energy expenditure. Identifying such microclimate refugia and understanding how alpine birds use them will help inform management strategies for conserving alpine ecosystems in the face of rapid temperature warming. This funded PhD project focuses on two focal species, Rock Ptarmigan and Rock Partridge, using state-of-the-art GPS tracking technology to quantify fine-scale movement patterns, as well as climate monitoring at study sites and land surface temperature mapping using a thermal drone. The project is located in the Swiss Alps and has completed two field seasons, with fieldwork projected to continue for an additional 1-2 years. 

The successful PhD Candidate will have access to the full study data set, with the opportunity to develop new field and/or analytical components depending upon logistics, expertise and interest. The Candidate must hold a MSc degree in biology or equivalent and ideally will show a strong interest in conservation science, environmental management and spatial analyses. 

Additional preferred (but not required) skills include: field experience studying birds or other vertebrates in montane landscapes, strong quantitative background with ability and interest to rapidly gain new skillsets related to the joint analysis of animal movement, climate, and remote sensing data, and knowledge of French and/or German. 

The project will be co-advised as a collaboration between Prof. Dr. Raphaël Arlettaz at University of Bern Division of Conservation Biology (Switzerland) and Assistant Professor Dr. Ian Ausprey at Texas A&M University Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology (USA). The Candidate will spend the first year at Uni Bern and the second two years at Texas A&M University and must be willing and able to commit to this schedule (exact timing negotiable). The PhD will be defended and granted at Uni Bern. 

Start: January 2026. Duration: 3 years, with possible prolongation. Salary according to SNSF rules. 

Applications must be submitted to ian.ausprey@ag.tamu.edu and should include a motivation letter describing your interests, experience and relevance for this position, a CV (including a list of publications if available), abstract of MSc thesis, and contact information for three professional references (institution, email, and phone number).

The application deadline is September 7th, 2025, with online interviews during the second half of September 2025.

Description
 Graduate Assistantship (M.S.), Grassland Plant Ecology 
 I am seeking a highly motivated individual to join a collaborative team studying the role of a dominant grazer in replanted, native grasslands.  The project utilizes sites that are part of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)—one of the largest grassland restoration initiatives in the U.S.  For example in Kansas, the CRP program has re-established approximately 1 million acres of native grassland; however, most of these sites do not include a dominant grazer despite the critical role that bison historically played in these systems.  Our project tests whether strategic cattle-grazing can enhance the conservation benefits to native plant communities and bird habitat in short and tallgrass prairie regions (Colorado and Kansas).  Two specific project objectives for this graduate position are to 1) quantify how grazers influence plant structural heterogeneity in ways that may improve habitat for wildlife and 2) examine how grazers influence the re-establishment of native plants.  
 This M.S. position requires someone who is self-motivated, works well with a team of field researchers, and has a strong interest in ecology.  The project will involve extensive fieldwork in Kansas and Colorado particularly during the summers.  Some knowledge of grassland plants is preferred, but strong students with the aptitude to learn plants quickly will also be considered.  Because we will be collaborating with private landowners, experience working in the United States is required as well as proficiency in spoken and written English.  Applicants should have an undergraduate degree in ecology, biology, or a related field and must meet the requirements for admission at Wichita State University.  Successful applicants will receive a 2-year assistantship with an annual stipend of $25,000 along with a tuition waiver and health benefits. This position begins January 2026.   To apply, email your CV, a transcript, and a letter describing your research interests and future goals to Dr. Greg Houseman (greg.houseman@wichita.edu).  An unofficial transcript will suffice for the initial application with an official copy needed if accepted into the program.  You do not need to apply to the Graduate School until you have been accepted into my lab.  Review of applications will begin Sept 15, 2025 and will continue until the positions is filled.  Please contact me if you have any questions!

LARGEMOUTH BASS GENOMICS MS ASSISTANTSHIP

Description: 

The Pregler Lab in the USGS New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Ecology at New Mexico State University invites applications for a MS research assistantship focused on population genomics of largemouth bass with an anticipated start of January 2026. 

This project will use genomic data to characterize the population structure and diversity of largemouth bass populations in New Mexico. A key objective is to determine which populations retain native New Mexico largemouth bass populations versus non-native hatchery strains from outside the state. New Mexico Department of Game & Fish biologists have also observed notable differences in growth rates among populations, with some growing much larger than others. As a result, there is strong interest in understanding the relative contributions of genetic versus environmental factors in driving these differences. Therefore, this project will also have opportunities to explore genotype-by-environment associations. The successful student will begin at NMSU in the spring 2026 semester (January) with their first field season beginning in May. The goal will be to sample largemouth bass populations across a number of reservoirs and rivers using boat electrofishing to obtain fin clips for later genetic analysis.

This project is a collaborative effort with New Mexico Department of Game & Fish and there may be opportunities to collaborate with other university partners and agencies. Benefits include a salary of $28,384 k/year, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance. Funding will also be available for conference travel and potential workshop training for data analyses. 

How to apply: If interested, please email Dr. Kasey Pregler (kpregler@nmsu.edu) (1) a statement of interest that describes your educational and research background, as well as your research interests and how this position fits in your career goals (2) curriculum vitae or resume, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts compiled in a single PDF and save as ‘LASTNAME_LMB_MS.PDF’. Please use ‘Largemouth Bass MS position’ in the email subject line. Application deadline is 09/12/25 11:59p MT for full consideration. You can learn more about the Pregler Lab at https://preglerlab.com. 

Qualifications: 

Required: B.S. in fisheries, biology, or related field and possession of a valid U.S. driver’s license. The successful applicant must also meet the minimum requirements for admission to the NMSU Graduate School (3.0 GPA in last two years of undergrad), as well as GRE scores for applicants who received their undergraduate degree outside the U.S. Applicants should also have demonstrated excellent written and oral communication skills, and an ability to work independently. 

Successful candidates will have proficiency in R, and some prior experience/exposure to bioinformatics is expected. Applicants with experience in fish ecology, statistical & genetic analyses of large datasets are encouraged to apply.

The Wild Turkey Lab (www.wildturkeylab.com) at the University of Georgia’s Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources is seeking a highly motivated M.S. student to join a collaborative research team investigating the ecology and management of wild turkeys. This work will focus on various ecological and behavioral aspects of wild turkeys.  The field research associated with this position will involve capture of wild turkeys, the use of GPS transmitters, and autonomous recording units to evaluate movements, reproductive ecology, and gobbling activity within the Piedmont region of Georgia.  This work is part of an ongoing, long-term research project that has spanned numerous study sites throughout the southeastern United States.  The successful candidate will have a single field season that will span ~8 months (January-August), followed by intermittent field work, and class work, data analysis, and thesis preparation.  One objective of the project is to investigate the influence of season structure, harvest regimes, and other factors on gobbling activity. Beyond this objective the student will work closely with project PIs to design a thesis that best suits his/her interests and will have access to the most comprehensive dataset collected on wild turkeys.  This dataset includes spatial data on turkeys and other species of interest, genetics, demographic, auditory, and image data from numerous study sites.  This project will also include assistance from field technicians, other graduate students working on the broader field effort, post-doctoral researchers, and collaboration with faculty from Louisiana State University, Tennessee Tech University, the University of Nebraska, and the University of Texas El Paso.  We are seeking applicants with a keen interest in ecology and conservation of wild turkeys, strong work ethic, basic knowledge of radio-telemetry and GPS, an understanding of the capabilities of GIS technology, an ability to safely operate all-terrain vehicles and 4-wheel drive trucks, and comfort climbing trees to deploy ARUs.

Prospective applicants should have research interests in entomology, ecology, and evolutionary biology, and should have strong field, lab, and analytical skills.  Applicants with previous experience using molecular techniques (e.g., PCR, NGS library preparation, metabarcoding, etc.) and bioinformatics are preferred.  Experience with GIS and/or R is also desirable. 
 Financial support will be provided through a combination of teaching and research assistantships.  Assistantships come with a full tuition (not fees) waiver and 67% of the student health insurance paid for by the university.  The selected applicant would need to be admitted to a Ph.D. program at the University of Arkansas for the Spring 2026 semester, which begins January 12, 2026.  Students admitted to a Ph.D. program may also be eligible for a U of A Doctoral Fellowship that adds to their assistantship stipend for 4 years.  More information about these fellowships can be found at: https://graduate-students.uark.edu/cost-and-funding/index.php.

Description
The Integrative Wildlife Conservation lab at Trent University, Ontario, Canada, in collaboration with the Lithops Research and Conservation Foundation, is offering a unique PhD project on the eco-evolutionary and conservation dynamics of Lithops spp., a genus of small succulent plants occurring in isolated colonies across desert landscapes in southern Africa. In the wild, Lithops are susceptible to human collection, habitat loss, and climate change, with many populations and species currently subject to high extinction risk. There are important knowledge gaps related to Lithops phylogeny and ecology that are currently impacting rigorous conservation status assessment and protection. Trent University is among only a handful of facilities worldwide housing Lithops plants and seeds originating from wild colonies, providing a truly unique opportunity to address integrative questions related to evolution, population genetics, and conservation biology in a controlled, rigorous and impactful context. The PhD project may include investigations related to genome sequencing, phylogenetics, evolutionary divergence, and linkage analysis, and adaptation to harsh environmental conditions, and the candidate will have the opportunity to develop specific research questions based on their interest and expertise. 

 Successful candidates MUST have an MSc in Biology, Genetics, Conservation, or related field, demonstrated evidence of peer-reviewed publications, strong lab and field skills, and an interest in working collaboratively within a large and diverse research group. Additional desirable qualifications include DNA sequencing, bioinformatics and GIS skills.  
 To apply, send a cover letter, curriculum vitae, unofficial academic transcript, and contact information for 3 references to: Dennis Murray (dennismurray@trentu.ca). 
 For additional details, see www.dennismurray.ca and www.lithopsfoundation.com. 
 The position will be filled as soon as a suitable candidate is found.

Description
Project Title: The Spatial-Temporal Activities, Habitat Selection, and Diet of the Understudied, Species of Greatest Conservation Need, the Western Massasauga Rattlesnake (Sistrurus tergeminus).
 Start Date: Preferred M.S. enrollment beginning in January 2026.
 Description: I am seeking TWO highly motivated M.S. students interested in herpetology, spatial ecology, and behavioral ecology to work on a field project involving Western Massasauga Rattlesnakes (Sistrurus tergeminus). These positions will be advised by Dr. Dylan Maag in the Department of Life, Earth, and Environmental Sciences at WTAMU. This project will be a highly collaborative effort requiring both graduate assistants to work simultaneously and with summer field technicians on all aspects of field data collection. Students will then focus separately on the analysis of spatial ecology and hunting behavior/diet, while working together on habitat selection for their theses, manuscripts, and project reports.
 S. tergeminus is currently a Species of Greatest Conservation Need in Texas and is native to Texas grasslands (one of the most endangered habitats in TX). This project is funded by the Texas Office of the Comptroller through their Endangered Species Management Research. Students will use a combination of mark-recapture, radiotelemetry, animal-borne accelerometry, field videography, habitat sampling, and diet analysis in the field starting in late spring 2026 to early fall 2028 to achieve the following objectives: 1) Obtain basic demographic statistics for the population of S. tergeminus. 2) Estimate the spatial ecology of adult S. tergeminus. 3) Quantify diel and seasonal activity, and species-typical behaviors of adult snakes. 4) Model S. tergeminus habitat selection at multiple scales. 5) Measure critical spatial, temporal, selection, and social variables associated with overwintering. 6) Estimate and measure the snakes’ diets and hunting behaviors.
 Prospective students should be comfortable working alone and in teams in the field and will be expected to mentor research technicians and undergraduate volunteers throughout the project. Students should also be comfortable with being trained to safety handle venomous snakes with the goal of them handling the snakes themselves. Students should also expect to regularly interact with both TX state biologists and managers, and private landowners throughout the project.
 Qualifications: B.S. in Biology, Wildlife Biology, Zoology, or a related field is required. Students must meet the qualifications of WTAMU’s graduate program for MS, Biology, https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/college-agriculture-natural-sciences/department-life-earth-environmental-sciences/programs/graduate/biology-graduate-program.html (3.0 GPA in all undergraduate related science courses, etc.). Students must also possess a valid Driver’s License. Experience handling venomous snakes is NOT required but is preferred. Students must be willing to be trained to safely handle venomous snakes and demonstrate proficiency in doing so. Experience working within the R coding language, GIS programs, and radiotelemetry are preferred but not required. Lastly, this project is set to last for 38 months thus, students must be prepared to devote 2.5–3 years towards this project and their MS degree at WTAMU.
 Compensation: These are fully funded graduate research assistant positions (i.e., no teaching) that comes with a stipend of $26,159–27,794 per year for 6 consecutive semesters, starting in Spring 2026. WTAMU graduate assistants also qualify for a partial tuition waiver and medical insurance coverage. For more information please visit WTAMU’s LEES department webpage, https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/college-agriculture-natural-sciences/department-life-earth-environmental-sciences/index.html, and WTAMU’s Graduate School webpage, https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/graduate-school/index.html. 
 How to Apply: Interested applicants should submit a single PDF document, which includes the following: 1) A letter of interest. 2) CV. 3) A copy of unofficial transcripts. 4) Contact information for three academic/professional references. Applications should be sent to Dr. Dylan Maag at dmaag@wtamu.edu and include “M.S. MASSASAUGA APPLICATION” in the subject line.

Applications will be reviewed starting on August 4th, 2025 applications submitted after that deadline will be reviewed as first-come-first-served basis until both positions are filled. Interviews (via Zoom or phone) of the short-listed applicants will begin within 2 weeks after the deadline of August 4th, 2025.

Description
 The James C. Kennedy Waterfowl and Wetlands Conservation Center at Clemson University is seeking a highly motivated Ph.D. or M.S. candidate to conduct research on materials for tidal trunks and other water control structures with the goal of developing alternative, cost-effective solutions for water level management in waterfowl impoundments in coastal South Carolina. 
 Water control structures are critical for effective wetland management. Historically, wooden tidal trunks had a life span of 25–30 years, but the discontinuation of chromate copper arsenate and creosote-treated lumber has reduced this to 8–10 years due to the use of pressure-treated lumber with alkaline copper quaternary preservatives. These trunks lose tensile strength from cyclic wetting and drying, salt crystal formation, decomposition, and insect colonization, with replacement costs reaching $20,000 to $25,000 each. Research is required to evaluate new materials and designs for tidal trunks while considering traditional design significance. The objectives of this study are to 1) inventory the number and characteristics of tidal trunks and other water control structures in South Carolina's coastal counties, 2) interview land managers and owners to evaluate critical and desirable design features of tidal trunks, 3) conduct a comprehensive literature review evaluating potential materials and designs, 4) document wildlife and invertebrate use of tidal trunks, 5) evaluate material performance, and 6) work with experienced tidal trunk builders to design, build, and install new prototypes.  
 The student will be working toward a graduate degree in Forest Resources, Biosystems Engineering, Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, or Civil Engineering at Clemson University. Clemson University (http://www.clemson.edu/about/) is a public land-grant Carnegie R1 Research University in a college town atmosphere on Lake Hartwell within view of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Students will take classes on the main campus and conduct fieldwork along South Carolina's coast at the Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center, the Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology and Forest Science, located on the 16,000-acre Hobcaw Barony property, and other coastal locations. 
 The student will be advised by a multidisciplinary team comprised of Dr. Christophe Darnault (Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences), Dr. Brunela Rodrigues (Wood Utilization and Biomaterials), Dr. Michael Stoner (Civil Engineering), and Dr. Jim Anderson (James C. Kennedy Waterfowl and Wetlands Conservation Center).  

QUALIFICATIONS: B.S. (for M.S.) and M.S. (for Ph.D.) in Environmental or Civil Engineering, Materials Science, Wood Science, Forest Engineering, Environmental Science, or a closely related field. Minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.00. A strong interest and experience in engineering design, material science, and design software is crucial. Interest in environmental sustainability, historic preservation, wetlands, statistics, and publishing is a plus. A valid driver’s license and reliable transportation is required. Due to current visa restrictions imposed by the United States government, you must be a United States citizen to apply for this position. 
 Clemson University does not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sexual orientation, gender, pregnancy, national origin, age, or disability. We encourage applications from minorities, women, veterans, and all other qualified applicants. 
 STIPEND: $25,000 (Ph.D.) or $22,000 (M.S.) plus tuition waiver. 
 CONTACT: Interested individuals should email a letter of interest, resume, a <1,000-word statement of purpose (why do you want to work on this project, your research interests, and long-term career goals), unofficial copy of transcripts, GRE/TOEFL scores (if available), proof of valid drivers license, examples of published papers, and contact information for 3 references to Ms. Crystal Anderson at crhode2@clemson.edu.

Description
Ph.D. or M.Sc.- Graduate Assistantship in American Black Duck Movement Ecology
Department of Natural Resources Science, University of Rhode Island
 
Project title: Effects of shellfish aquaculture disturbances on American black ducks.

A graduate assistantship is available at the Ph.D. or M.Sc. level to study the spatial and movement ecology of American Black Ducks in southern New England. This project will hinge on the capture and marking of individuals with GPS transmitters and implementation of experimental shellfish aquaculture operations to determine the extent to which the presence of pseudo-aquaculture farms influences American black duck space use, energetic costs, and habitat selection behavior, and to quantify the importance of inland water sources to American black ducks responding to the presence of pseudo-aquaculture farms. We expect the results from this project to directly inform waterfowl management. This study is a continuation of a long-term effort between the university and state agency to understand the relationships between shellfish aquaculture and waterfowl ecology in Rhode Island.

Qualifications: Only hard-working, motivated, intelligent, good-natured persons interested in waterfowl ecology and movements need apply. Applicants must have completed an undergraduate degree in animal/wildlife biology or ecology, earned at least a 3.2 GPA, and must have excellent oral and written communication skills. Field experience with waterfowl capture and handling and operating boats is highly desirable. Experience with quantitative analysis and field research is required.  If applying for the PhD level assistantship, applicants who have successfully completed a relevant M.Sc. are strongly preferred and those applicants with only a BSc degree must have exceptional and relevant field experience to be considered. If applying for the M.Sc. level assistantship, applicants must have exceptional and relevant field experience to be considered. Ability to work collaboratively and to supervise research assistants and undergraduates working in the field is also required. Stipends are approx. $25,000/academic year dependent on graduate assistantship level, tuition is paid, and an additional summer stipend of approx. $18,000 is provided. Starting date is either January 2026 or September 2026.

To apply submit the following: a letter stating your qualifications and research interests, a resume or CV, unofficial college transcripts, and the names and contact information for 3 references by no later than 15 September 2025 (early application is encouraged) to:

Description
Mote Marine Laboratory is seeking candidates for a Mote Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Marine Biomedical Research. The Marine Biomedical Research Program has historically focused on basic and applied research using elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and stingrays) as laboratory animal models directed primarily at characterizing elasmobranch immune cell-derived proteins and venoms from stingray spines, as well as development of novel cell lines. Over the next several years, Mote will be undertaking a significant cross-cutting evolution of several existing research programs, including Marine Biomedical, Immunology, Molecular Microbiology, and Ecotoxicology, along with establishing a new Medicinal Chemistry Research Program to launch a new Derived Products from the Sea Initiative with the goal of identifying untapped sources of unique and novel marine natural products and studying various marine model organisms which contribute to human health and other sciences as well as creating licensable intellectual property. We envision the successful candidate for the Marine Biomedical Mote Postdoctoral Research Fellowship position will be instrumental in growing this broader initiative. It is strongly recommended that applicants have a background in combinations of immunology, biochemistry, elasmobranch/marine organismal biology/physiology, and/or cell culture techniques.

Mote Background:

In 2025, Mote will be celebrating 70 years as one of the few remaining independent, non-profit international marine research laboratories. Mote’s ocean and coastal research enterprise has 35 research units, an array of STEM education/outreach efforts, and an aquarium featuring teaching and working laboratories with more than 100 marine species. Mote currently has more than 40 PhD-level scientists, over 300 staff, and approximately 1500 volunteers that are located on its main campus in Sarasota and across eight additional campuses/facilities including a state-of-the-art 200 acre marine and freshwater aquaculture research park, a 19,000 square foot International Center for Coral Reef Research & Restoration in the Florida Keys and work is nearing completion for a new 145,000 square foot Mote Science Education Aquarium (Mote SEA). The Mote scientific expertise is considerable and diverse, and is augmented by more than 150 non-resident scientists from more than 100 different U.S. and international institutions who are involved in projects with Mote all around the world.

Fellowship Program:

Mote Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are three-year positions providing 100% salary support, funding assistance for equipment/supplies and travel, and office and laboratory space. The Fellowship includes mentorship from a diversity of cross-discipline Mote scientists and administrative assistance for grant proposals, contract compliance, and reporting.

Three graduate research assistantships (Ph.D. (preferred) or M.S.) in aquatic ecology and harmful algal blooms are available in Alan Wilson’s lab at Auburn University (https://www.wilsonlab.com/).  We are an active and productive lab with current research projects that are funded by a variety of grants from USDA ARS, USDA NIFA, NSF Dimensions of Biodiversity, and USGS that leverage our field station that includes hundreds of aquaculture ponds and nearby recreational and drinking water reservoirs.  Here, we pursue basic and applied questions associated with understanding the ecological, evolutionary, and limnological mechanisms controlling the structure and function of freshwater plankton communities.  Harmful algal blooms are the foci for many of our projects.  My students are welcome to participate on existing projects, which include large-scale field experiments and monitoring, lab-based analytical analyses, modeling, and meta-analysis, but are strongly encouraged to develop their own projects  in addition to applying for external grants and fellowships, such as the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship program.  There are numerous opportunities to work directly with important stakeholders, such as aquaculture farmers, water utilities, and natural resource managers.

I am motivated to maintain a productive, diverse, and inclusive lab and encourage students from under-represented groups to consider joining us.  Moreover, lab members are strongly encouraged to develop outreach activities to broaden the impact of their research.

Qualifications: Ideal candidates will be data driven, hard-working, honest, highly self-motivated, team-oriented, and excited about studying freshwater communities.  Prior coursework in ecology, limnology, and statistics, a strong interest in mentoring undergraduates and participating in outreach, and relevant research experiences (including analytical skills, such molecular, GC-MS, GC-FID, HPLC, ELISA) are desirable, but not required. 

Support: Competitive graduate research assistantships (starting for Ph.D. = $35k/yr and M.S. = $30k/yr) include 12-month stipend and full tuition waivers.  Highly qualified Ph.D. candidates will be considered for an AU Presidential Graduate Research Fellowship (http://graduate.auburn.edu/au-presidential-graduate-research-fellowships/) or AU Presidential Graduate Opportunity Fellowship (http://graduate.auburn.edu/prospective-students/presidential-graduate-opportunity-program/), which can last 3 years and include an annual stipend of at least $50,000.  Moreover, all students in the lab are well supported to conduct high quality research and are strongly encouraged and supported to share their research at scientific conferences.

Start date: Flexible but Spring and Summer 2025 would be ideal considering current projects. 
 
How to apply: Interested students are encouraged to submit their application materials (CV, GRE scores (if available), copies of transcripts, and contact information for three references) at https://forms.gle/WocXAMDtfSs5vWHm9

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Forest Service Northern Research Station (NRS), Northern Forest Climate Hub (NFCH) located in Houghton, Michigan.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: A fellowship opportunity is available with the USDA Northern Forest Climate Hub (NFCH) to provide useable science and technology on climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation responses to meet the needs of communities and natural resources professionals across the Midwest and Northeast US. The primary focus of this fellowship is to create an ecosystem vulnerability assessment for priority terrestrial ecosystems across the Midwest and Northeast US. The assessment will synthesize current information from ecosystem models, published research, Indigenous Knowledge, and land managers, building on previous efforts and adopting contemporary approaches for accessibility and use. The assessment will serve as a synthesis of the best available science on climate change impacts and the vulnerability of ecosystems in the Midwest and Northeast US (20-state area corresponding to the FS Eastern Region). This information will be prepared for professional land managers, forest practitioners, land stewards, and others seeking information to integrate climate change considerations into planning and management. Notable applications include National Forest and Grassland Management Plans, State Forest Action Plans, and project-level ecosystem management. 

The fellow will be a part of a team of NFCH to prepare the assessment. The fellow will also collaborate with partners across other agencies and institutions, including federal, state, tribal, conservation organizations, forest sector, and universities.  It will be essential for the fellow to balance multiple responsibilities, to clearly communicate with team members, and to be flexible to shifting priorities. The primary learning experience for the fellow will be to review literature and help write major portions of the vulnerability assessment. The fellow will be a lead author for multiple assessment chapters. Supplemental learning opportunities for the fellow will include analyzing data, developing web tools, facilitating meetings, delivering presentations, and designing outreach materials.

Learning Objectives: 

The participant will learn scientific and technical knowledge related to climate change trends, projections, ecosystem impacts, management implications, ecosystem vulnerability, and various implications to society. The participant will gather and apply information across a 20-state region of the Midwest and Northeast US.  
The participant will learn best practices for communicating technical scientific information to a professional audience, including preparing a large assessment for publication as a Forest Service General Technical Report, developing companion online tools and outreach products, and delivering presentations to diverse audiences.
Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Maria Janowiak (maria.janowiak@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: September 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year and four months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $66,036 annually.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Questions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email ORISE.USFS.NRS@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.

Graduate Student Position Announcement - Utah State University – Spring 2026
 Position title: Ph.D. Graduate Research Assistantship (GRA), Mountains as disease refugia for moose in a changing world
 Position description: The GRA will study how animals can use spatial refugia, behavioral adaptations, and/or movement-related strategies to adapt to warming climates and increased parasite exposure. Research will focus on moose and their parasites (winter ticks, arterial worms) in the Wasatch Mountains, Utah. Key aims include: 1) assessing how climate and parasites impact moose dispersal, movement, and habitat selection; 2) understanding how adaptive strategies in movement can affect moose reproduction, survival, and population persistence; and 3) developing future projections of how moose spatial distributions will change in response to climate and parasites.
 The GRA will conduct field work to monitor moose with GPS radio-collars to understand movement and demography in relation to parasite loads. They will monitor moose movement using ground-based surveys and conduct field examinations of moose mortalities to determine cause of death. In addition, the GRA will build advanced habitat selection, movement, and population models of moose in response to changing climate conditions and parasite numbers to help inform moose management in Utah. Research will be conducted in collaboration with agency scientists and managers at the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, and another GRA studying moose-parasite interactions.
 Supervisors: Dr. T.J. Clark-Wolf, Department of Wildland Resources and Ecology Center; Dr. Sara Weinstein, Department of Biology, Utah State University

Description
Description:

Located within Colored Sands Forest Preserve in Northwest Winnebago County, Illinois, Sand Bluff Bird Observatory is one of the largest small-bird banding operations in the country that is open to the public. Sand Bluff was created to study population trends in migrant birds, although we also trap resident species as well. In a typical year 4-6,000 warblers, vireos, orioles, sparrows, thrushes, and finches are banded. The data collected by Sand Bluff Observatory is vital in helping scientists and government agencies understand the status of these birds both nationally, and internationally. Although Sand Bluff is primarily a research facility, visitors are always welcome to come watch our operation and share in the learning process.
 Purpose:

Sand Bluff Bird Observatory is operated entirely by volunteers and is always looking for help! Do you want to know more about birds? Do you want to know how to identify birds in the field or in the hand? Do you enjoy facilitating public education programming about the value of avian ecology? Do you want to learn about bird banding and develop your own banding skills?

Sand Bluff Bird Observatory offers all the above experience and more! No previous knowledge is needed to be a volunteer, just the willingness to learn at you own pace. While most volunteers help with data entry/recording, taking birds out of mist nets, or banding birds, there are many other important tasks to keep this great organization running. We have visitor education, database programming, event set up, data analysis, and technical writing that we could use your assistance with.

Please note: Sand Bluff Bird Observatory operates under a “Station Permit” issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The permit is granted to SBBO for the purpose of collecting field data on the age, sex, and populations of non-game species. While the observatory also serves as a regional environmental education resource, this function is secondary and must not interfere with the intent of permit or bird welfare. Additionally, volunteers must be certified to run mist nets and handle birds by senior volunteers. After certification, all volunteers must continue to follow bird handling and banding guidelines. It is the responsibility of all new volunteers to learn these procedures and follow them. Failure to do so may injure birds, degrade the quality of the data collected, result in revocation of banding permit, or rescinding of volunteer ability to participate in banding.  Trainees may remove and handle birds only under direct supervision by a certified observatory volunteer and will only independently remove/handle/band birds upon respective certification by station master.

 

Volunteer Duties & Learning Opportunities:

-              Assist in removing migratory and native birds from mist nets on “runs” every 45-60 minutes under ideal weather conditions, more often as conditions worsen. Learn safe and responsible bird handling techniques for mist net removal, bagging for transport to banding station, banding, and release. Birds must be processed and released as quickly as possible to mitigate stress or injury incurred by wildlife.
-               Utilize reference materials and collective volunteer knowledge to develop bird identification skills of migratory and residential species.
-              Assist in data collection and recording during capture and banding procedures.
-              Adhere to all disease management procedures, including single-use and sanitation of bird bags to prevent the spread of disease.
-              Develop skills in bird health assessment (body condition, stress, injury, etc.).
-              Assist in public engagement programming concerning SBBO’s bird banding process and duty to conservation
-              Assist in database programming and analysis of population, age, sex, and recapture data.
-              Develop bird banding skills under the guidance of station master or certified volunteer.

 

Hours: Banding sessions will be conducted Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays from mid-August till the end of mid-November, starting at 07:00 am to 12:00 pm (weather permitting). Check out our website or Facebook page for more information on startup.

Description
ROLE OVERVIEW:
 Are you ready to leverage your expertise and take on a leadership role in the field of environmental consulting? At SummitWest, the Senior Wildlife Biologist at SummitWest is a subject matter expert who will leverage their extensive experience in wildlife, botanical,  or wetland field surveys to support natural resource projects throughout California and occasionally in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, and beyond.

The Senior Wildlife Biologist will lead field surveys, mentor junior staff, guide project planning, and assist with report preparation, permitting, and client coordination. This position requires exceptional organizational skills, flexibility, and a collaborative spirit to manage projects in a variety of terrains and weather conditions. 

If you’re motivated by dynamic challenges, enjoy mentoring the next generation of professionals, and excel at driving compliance success in the field, this is the opportunity for you.

ROLE DESCRIPTION & DUTIES:
The Senior Wildlife Biologist will conduct diverse natural resource tasks under the guidance of Project Managers, Environmental Coordinators, and Environmental Schedulers. Duties include but are not limited to:

KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
Construction Monitoring: Oversee environmental compliance during construction, including worker awareness programs, pre-construction surveys, and real-time site monitoring.
Field Surveys: Conduct botanical, wildlife, and/or wetland field surveys across a variety of diverse terrains and weather conditions.
Endangered Species and Habitat Surveys: Perform presence/absence and protocol-level surveys for specialized species, requiring Recovery permits. 
Data Collection and Management: Utilize ESRI software and other tools for data collection, quality control (QC), and report writing.
Compliance Support: Provide biological desktop reviews, create permitting packages, assist with GIS mapping, and ensure adherence to regulatory requirements.
Project Oversight: Guide proposal submissions, budget development, project planning, and assist in bid interviews and client meetings.
Team Collaboration: Maintain open and concise communication with project teams, contractors, and clients.
Reporting: Prepare technical studies, daily monitoring reports, and compliance documentation.
Mentorship and Leadership: Train and mentor junior staff while serving as a subject matter expert for technical guidance.
Quality Control: Conduct thorough reviews of field data and reports to ensure accuracy and timeliness.

ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES:
Provide biological desktop support, including assisting with project management tasks.
Travel to various project sites throughout California and occasionally to other states, including Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, and beyond.
Perform biological survey fieldwork for wildlife, botanical resources, and habitat assessments, including presence/absence surveys, and endangered species surveys, independently or as part of a team.
Monitor environmental compliance by coordinating with project managers, engineers, and construction contractors. This includes conducting worker environmental awareness programs, on-site monitoring with construction crews, and post-construction analysis.
Assist in the oversight of SWE projects or assignments, including correspondence and coordination with other SWE employees, clients, and construction crews.
Utilize electronic data collection methods and manage project data. This includes preparing daily technical reports, technical studies, and full project reports.
Work remotely while being self-sufficient, trustworthy, and adhering to company standards, including maintaining safety and professional Code of Conduct per company policies.
Safely operate company or personal vehicles used for work purposes in compliance with the company’s Driving Policy.

PLEASE NOTE: This is an environmental consulting job, not a conservation job. Unlike conservation roles, which strive to protect the environment at all costs, this position focuses on helping construction contractors remain in compliance with environmental laws and mitigation measures, ensuring the client avoids issues by advising contractors on where, when, and how work can take place to prevent delays in construction. These determinations are often made prior to deployment into the field, or sometimes in conjunction with the contractors on site. It is vital to ensure that they are not working without our knowledge and requires clear and concise communication with multiple team members, crews, and departments.

QUALIFICATIONS:
EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:
PhD, or MSc in biology, ecology, environmental studies or related field, OR a cumulative 10+ years of experience in biological field work and/or environmental consulting (only 4+ years required in addition to the PhD; 8+ years in addition to the MSc).
7+ years working with endangered species or habitats.
4+ years of compliance monitoring experience.
Must hold at least two (2) endangered species permits (from USFWS, CDFW, or similar). 
 SKILLS AND ABILITIES: 
Technologically proficient with handheld electronic devices and proficient in computer software including Excel, MS word, Google Sheets.

PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS: 
4x4 driving experience.
Background in California field work or environmental consulting.

EXPECTATIONS:

WORKING CONDITIONS:

Description
 Description

The Great Basin Institute will recruit and support an Administrative Historian who will complete a new administrative history for John Day Fossil Beds National Monument (JODA). The historian at JODA will engage in researching and writing a comprehensive history of how JODA has been managed from 1996 to the present day, including important issues in planning, land acquisition, development, public relations, and other topics of ongoing management concern. The final narrative reference will consist of a scholarly examination of the administrative history of the unit and will serve as a valuable tool for future park managers and scholars. The research effort resulting from this project will significantly expand the site’s reference and archival files and provide additional information for park staff. Finally, the administrative history will be placed on JODA’s website to make the information widely available to the public.
A chronology of land acquisitions, paleontology research, archaeology surveys, park developments, special programs, resource protection and mitigation, and personnel changes are necessary to conduct many aspects of everyday park operations as well as in preparation for the Park’s 50-year anniversary in 2025. There has been a high degree of turnover at the Park recently. As such, there has been a great deal of loss of institutional memory. Having a new administrative history will help capture institutional knowledge and prevent further loss. The historian will create a published scholarly, and comprehensively updated report bridging the gap between the last administrative history report, in 1996, and the present. This report will be a substantial aid in the documentation of the history of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.
Description:
The updated administrative history will include photos and graphics as well as a comprehensive assessment of primary and secondary sources in local, regional, state and national archives.  Oral history interviews will be conducted with present and former NPS staff, park partners, volunteers and others. These interviews will require travel to meet individuals both within the commuting distance of the park and outside of it. The study will be prepared by a professional historian who meets the Secretary of the Interior’s standards for historians and follows the guidelines outlined in Director’s Order 28.
Project Objectives:
This project will result in a published scholarly, and comprehensively updated report bridging the gap between the 1996 report and the present and will be a substantial aid in the documentation of the history of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. This historic report will research and document cultural resources of the park from 1996 to present and is a baseline document. As appropriate, data from this research and the archive of the 1997 administrative history will be added to the park archives and entered into MCMS, and copies of the finished product will be added to the park’s library as well as disseminated to other appropriate areas. A PDF copy will also be made available through the IRMA database for wider access.
Project milestones include review of previous Administrative History, interviews with current JODA staff, identifying former JODA staff to interview and pertinent oral history questions to ask, gathering of archival data, and the synthesis of the final report. The historian will have monthly meetings with the JODA site supervisor to evaluate progress.
Location:
John Day Fossil Beds NM is situated in the John Day River Valley and surrounding lands. There are three separate units (Sheep Rock, Clarno, and Painted Hills) which are between one and two-hour drives away from each other. The area of paleontological interest consists of over 10,000 square miles cooperatively managed by the NPS, BLM, and USFS. Elevation in the region varies from 1,500 feet to 9,000 feet. Vegetation includes sagebrush/bunchgrass steppe, junipers, and forests of firs, ponderosas, and aspens. Weather in summer tends to be hot and dry with little precipitation and high temperatures regularly exceeding 100 degrees F. The area is remote and rural, with several nearby towns (population <200 people) and more distant towns of several thousand. Limited grocery shopping options are available in smaller towns near the monument (~10 miles distant), but the nearest grocery store, pharmacy, and hospital are about 45 miles from park headquarters (Sheep Rock Unit). More facilities and services are available in the Bend area which is about 120 miles from the Sheep Rock Unit. The closest airport is in Redmond, OR, about two-hour drive from the Sheep Rock Unit. Other airports are in Boise, ID, Pasco, WA, and Portland, OR.

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Southwest Research Station (PSWRS). This project is based at three long-term ecohydrological research sites (Soaproot, Newt Creek, and Providence), which are managed by the PSWRS of the USDA FS in the Sierra Nevada.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: The participant will engage in field-based research examining the impacts of wildfire and drought-induced tree mortality on water quality and quantity in headwater forest ecosystems.

The participant will collect water and gas samples from boreholes, soils, and streams, with a focus on capturing spatiotemporal variation in hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to disturbance. Specific activities will include participating in field campaigns to monitor moisture dynamics, collecting and analyzing water samples for major ions, nutrients, water stable isotopes, and carbon isotopes, and assisting in the maintenance and calibration of field instrumentation.

Laboratory activities will involve preparing and analyzing samples using techniques such as ion chromatography and isotope ratio spectroscopy. The participant will collaborate closely with graduate students and project collaborators to synthesize results, compare site responses, and contribute to research on how forest structure and climate extremes shape water availability and watershed function.

Learning Objectives: This opportunity will provide training in hydrologic instrumentation, sample analysis, and environmental data interpretation, supporting the agency’s mission to advance science-based forest and water resource management.

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is David Dralle (david.dralle@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for 3 months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $16,251.10 monthly.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Questions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email ORISE.USFS.PSWRS@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.

Qualifications
The qualified candidate should be a faculty member at a US institution and returning to the University at the completion of the appointment.

We have three large scale projects and several smaller scale LTER experiments that require most of our intern resources. BioCON is one of the large-scale experiments where we explore the ways in which plant communities respond to environmental changes such as increased nitrogen deposition, increased atmospheric CO2, decreased biodiversity, altered precipitation patterns, and increased temperatures. Another large-scale project is the Big Biodiversity experiment that studies how plant diversity affects the rates, dynamics, and stability of ecological processes at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. Other experiments nested within the Big Biodiversity look at factors such as irrigation and increased temperatures. The third large scale experiment, FAB, is looking at tree competition under different diversity levels. This experiment includes approximately 40,000 trees within a 30-acre field that will run for over 100 years. Throughout the summer we maintain and sample these experiments. 

Research Site
CCESR is an eight square mile tract of land 35 miles north of the Twin Cities. Cedar Creek is endowed with a diverse mosaic of prairie, savanna, sedge meadows, bogs, open water, forests, and even abandoned agricultural fields. Its large size, great natural diversity, and uniform soil substrate make it ideal for ecosystem studies.

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Forest Service Northern Research Station (NRS) located in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Grand Rapids is a small, rural community in north-central Minnesota. The Forestry Sciences Laboratory is located on the University of Minnesota North Central Research and Outreach Center adjacent to the Minnesota North Community College - Itasca Campus. 

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: The chemistry laboratory in the Grand Rapids Forestry Sciences Laboratory supports studies of forest and resource management. The office is part of the Research and Development program of the Northern Research Station (NRS) of the USDA Forest Service. The primary opportunity of the fellows will be to participate in the preparation of samples for chemical analysis and learn a range of skills associated with a chemistry laboratory. Samples may be soils, sediments, plant tissues, or water collected from studies. In addition to research of NRS scientists, the laboratory supports analysis for the NRS Forest Inventory and Analysis Program, the Air Resource Monitoring Program, other cooperating federal agencies, and academic partners. The opportunity will include cataloging and organization of incoming samples, processing and preparing samples for analysis and entering of data produced during analysis. Fellows will collaborate with the laboratory manager (chemist), a physical sciences technician, and other staff associated with mentoring by a hydrologist/project leader (supervisor of all staff within the local research unit).

Learning Objectives: Fellows arriving with more advanced skills and experience with chemical analysis may be provided the opportunity to learn about instrument calibration, operation, and data quality control/quality assurance procedures, or operate analytical instruments for the measurement for basic inorganic solutes/constituents and nutrients. The fellow/s will be exposed to both research and research operations support, which are both germane to gaining insight of routine stages of many different science support positions within research institutions, whether in a federal government research agency, academia, or the commercial sector. 

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Stephen Sebestyen (stephen.sebestyen@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: September 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is part time. The opportunity is in the range of 10 to 20 hours per week, with flexible hours within period between 6:30 AM to 4:30 PM, weekdays only, typically during the academic year (fall and spring semesters only).  A fellow is expected to reliably complete the agreed upon total hours per month (based upon 10-20 hr per week).

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $680 per month, but contingent on participation level.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.

Ownership and resilience: You care deeply about getting results. You gather information, seek input, and drive work forward to the finish line. You think 3 (or 30) steps ahead to develop solutions, anticipate problems, and course-correct when needed. You hold a high bar even when things are hectic and bounce back from setbacks by turning each hurdle into a learning opportunity.
Adaptability and problem solving: You are always ready to take advantage of unexpected opportunities and address obstacles. You look for the root of both simple and complex problems, so you can seek solutions. You approach work with a spirit of “yes” and adapt as things change, which they often do.

Graduate Opportunities
Description
 *Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Forest Service Southern Research Station (SRS) located in Durham, North Carolina. The opportunity may be remote.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

The mission of the United States Forest Service (USFS) Southern Research Station (SRS) is to create science and technology needed to sustain and enhance forest ecosystems and the benefits they provide. The Center for Economics and Social Science (CESS), located within USFS-SRS, includes the Forest Economics and Policy Unit (RWU-4804). The research mission of the unit is to advance the science between natural and human-caused disturbances and economic values, and how those disturbances can be managed to reduce undesired impacts on society and ecosystems.

Research Project: The Forest Economic and Policy Unit is seeking an ORISE participant to help quantify the economic effectiveness of wildfire prevention programs (and their associated “activities”) at reducing human-caused wildfires on Tribal lands in the United States. The purpose of this experience will be to quantify temporal and spatial effects of fire prevention programs on human ignitions by including individual management practices from a time series dataset. We expect that the participant will use econometric methods to approach this research objective.

Learning Objectives: The ORISE participant will learn about relevant fire prevention programs, fire prevention activities, and associated datasets. In addition, the participant will receive guidance with novel econometric techniques, and receive support with scientific writing.

The participant will have the opportunity to collaborate and receive mentorship from scientists and mangers in USFS and Bureau of Indian Affairs. The participant will develop scientific writing and econometric skills, as well as increase proficiency using statistical software (such as STATA or R).

Description
The Palmquist Lab at Marshall University is recruiting for a funded MS position at Marshall University in climate change and fire effects on coastal vegetation. Our research focuses on quantifying vegetation dynamics over space and time and identifying how the relative importance of ecological processes structuring plant communities changes with spatial and temporal scale. In addition, a key goal of our research is to understand how pattern and process in plant communities will be altered in the face of global environmental change. An important motivation for our work is to address ecological questions at large spatial scales to inform landscape conservation. We collect field data, use existing large observational data sets, and implement simulation modeling to address these goals in temperate shrublands, wetlands, woodlands, and forests. Additional information about the lab can be found at http://www.kylepalmquist.org/.
 RESEARCH FOCUS: The successful candidate will explore the interacting effects of sea-level rise and increased storm surge on coastal vegetation and the effects of prescribed fire on pine-dominated vegetation on Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island (MCRDPI), a sea-island in South Carolina. Coastal vegetation provides important ecosystem services, including storm protection, erosion control, and habitat for wildlife. These complex, highly zoned plant communities are structured by multiple environmental factors including salinity, elevation, soil texture, soil moisture, exposure, and light availability. Sea-level rise and intensification of the hydrologic cycle (i.e. more frequent and intense storms) is expected to affect the distribution and composition of coastal vegetation in the future, with important implications. Prescribed fire has been implemented in pine woodlands and forests on the island to enhance their resilience to climate change and to restore their structure from closed forests to open woodlands. The effects of prescribed fire have yet to be assessed. The project will integrate remote sensing, plant community sampling, and modeling to quantify how sea-level rise and associated factors have impacted coastal vegetation up to present and how climate change may influence vegetation in the future. An additional goal is to assess how prescribed fire is influencing pine-dominated vegetation on the island by installing and re-sampling permanent vegetation plots.   
 PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS: A background, including relevant course work, in botany or plant ecology, and GIS or remote sensing, strong communication skills, and strong quantitative skills. Experience in remote sensing and GIS and knowledge of the southeastern US flora is highly desirable.
 EXPECTATIONS: The successful candidate will be expected to conduct high-quality research, serve as a teaching assistant within the Department of Biological Sciences, present their research to the scientific community at regional and national meetings, and publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
 TIMELINE: The position is available starting January 2026 and possibly before.
 FUNDING: Funding will consist of a combination of research and teaching assistantships for two years. A 12-month competitive stipend ($20,000), and full tuition waiver will be provided. The student is responsible for covering University fees.
 HOW TO APPLY: Interested students should apply by submitting the following to Dr. Kyle Palmquist (palmquist@marshall.edu): 1) short statement of research interests and career goals (no longer than 1 page), 2) CV, 3) unofficial transcripts, and 4) contact information for three professional references. Please include: “MS position – coastal vegetation” and your name in the email subject.
 Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until a candidate is selected. I will contact you to discuss your research interests and goals for graduate school if I determine you would be a good fit for the lab. If selected, a full application must be submitted to the Department of Biological Sciences at Marshall University, Huntington, WV. Faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences have expertise in a variety of biological fields, including but not limited to ecology, evolution, herpetology, and physiology. More information about the Department and its programs can be found here: https://www.marshall.edu/biology/. Application requirements for admission to the DBS graduate program can be found here: https://www.marshall.edu/biology/admission/.
 Marshall University is located in Huntington, an affordable college town located on the Ohio River in the beautiful state of West Virginia.

Description
 *Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF), located in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, or remote. 

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

The International Institute of Tropical Forestry (the Institute), headquartered in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, is a research and technology transfer institute that is dedicated to advancing tropical forestry on insular, national, and international levels, and developing and exchanging knowledge critical to sustaining benefits of tropical forests and grasslands.  The IITF mission is to develop and disseminate scientifically based knowledge that contributes to the conservation of forests, wildlife, and watersheds of the American tropics in the context of environmental change. Current foci include silviculture and forest dynamics, wildfire risk management and forest inventory. The Research and Development mission of the USFS is to develop and deliver knowledge and innovative technology to improve management of the Nation's forests and grasslands—both public and private including National Forest lands.

Proposed Project: The participant will conduct landscape-scale research with existing forest inventory and geospatial data to improve techniques and knowledge in one of three priority areas: forest inventory and analysis, timber production and forest dynamics, or wildfire risk management. The focus will be on mixed species forests of the U.S., including but not limited to subtropical zones. Potential topics include research to improve the precision of forest inventory estimates of trends in timber and non-timber forest products with remote sensing and other geospatial data, or to improve forest management and reduce wildfire risk through improved understanding of the dynamics of economically valuable species and invasive species that may compete with economically valuable species or promote wildfire.

Learning Objectives: The postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to apply their experience and knowledge to a new geographic area and set of tree species. They will also have opportunities to present analyses and outputs in workshops, seminars, reports and peer-reviewed publications developed and co-authored with mentors and collaborators. Outputs will be shared with forest managers from industry, the public sector, other landowners and other scientists and land managers.

Mentor: The mentors for this opportunity are  Eileen Helmer (eileen.helmer@usda.gov) and Tamara Heartsill-Scalley (tamara.heartsill-scalley@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNWRS) located in Seattle, Washington.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: collaborating with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: Wildland fires emit a wide variety of trace gases and aerosols which are harmful to human health. When wildfires occur, millions of people may be exposed to unhealthy and sometimes hazardous air quality conditions, often for days or weeks. Yet, wildland fire is also a natural part of many ecosystems. Prescribed burning is used in various regions of the US to maintain ecosystem health, as well as a means of protecting people and resources from wildfire.

We are looking for a fellow to participate in a project that seeks to substantially upgrade and expand the suite of tools available for documenting and forecasting wildland fire smoke transport and dispersion. The project objective is to improve both wildfire and prescribed fire operational decision support in various landscapes. They will interact with a team focused on developing new systems and novel techniques and tools, such as improving smoke modeling systems through a variety of means. This may include multi-model approaches, statistical and machine learning, coupled fire behavior/fire atmosphere modeling, air quality modeling, and system evaluation. Depending on their skills and interests, they can participate in various aspects of the project, including an upgraded fire tracking system; improved estimates of fire emissions that include uncertainty bounds suitable to emissions inventories; and more accurate and advanced smoke modeling capabilities.

Learning Objectives: The fellow will develop professionally while engaging in research-operational partnerships and learning about systems involving air quality monitoring, fire emissions, and smoke modeling developed through the USFS Fire and Aviation Management-led Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program. They will gain experience with complex datasets from surface observational systems, remote sensing systems, including recent NOAA and NASA satellite launches, and computer modeling systems. 

Mentor: The mentors for this opportunity are Susan O’Neill (susan.oneill1@usda.gov), Sim Larkin (sim.larkin@usda.gov), Tony Bova (anthony.bova@usda.gov), Brian Potter (brian.potter@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: Summer 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Description
At RES, we’re looking for purpose-driven individuals who are passionate about restoration and sustainability, and who want their work to make a lasting environmental impact. Our team members go above and beyond, bringing initiative, integrity, and a strong work ethic to every project. Collaboration is key—we thrive on teamwork, open communication, and diverse perspectives. In a field that constantly changes, we value those who are resilient, adaptable, and resourceful in the face of challenges. If you're intellectually curious, eager to learn, and ready to help restore ecosystems and protect natural resources, you’ll find your place here.

RES is looking for a Scientist IV to join our team.

As a Scientist IV at RES, you’ll serve as a senior technical expert, project team leader, and mentor to early-career scientists. You will manage interdisciplinary field teams, conduct advanced scientific analysis, and ensure that data collection and reporting meet rigorous technical, regulatory, and quality standards. You will play a critical role in interpreting ecological data, guiding project strategy, and delivering high-value outcomes for clients across restoration, mitigation, and compliance efforts. 

This position is based in our Fort Lauderdale, FL office, and the selected candidate is expected to work from the office via a hybrid schedule. Some travel and overnight stays are anticipated. Approximately 60-70% of your time will be spent in the field, supporting projects across South and Central Florida.

Why You’ll Love This Job

You’ll be the go-to technical expert. Your insights and leadership will shape project decisions, mentor rising talent, and support ecological outcomes across regions.
You’ll lead meaningful science. Whether it’s analyzing wetlands, monitoring threatened species, or designing sampling protocols, your work will directly impact restoration success.
You’ll have variety and influence. One day might involve designing a functional assessment approach; the next, presenting scientific findings to a client or regulatory agency.
You’ll help grow people and projects. As a senior scientist, you’ll mentor junior team members, guide their growth, and shape technical strategy at every project phase.
 

A Day in the Life


Your day might begin by leading a morning field briefing for a multi-disciplinary team conducting a compliance visit at a restoration site. You’ll ensure protocols are followed, calibrate equipment, and troubleshoot field challenges. Back in the office, you might review QA/QC on monitoring data from another region, advise on permitting language, or refine a risk assessment for an upcoming project.

As a senior team member, you may be reviewing reports for scientific accuracy, contributing to the technical content of proposals, or collaborating with clients to develop site-specific assessment strategies. You are also actively mentoring junior scientists, answering fieldwork questions, or guiding them through advanced ecological methods or regional permitting nuances.

 We would like to talk to you if you have many of the following:

Bachelor’s degree in environmental science, biology, ecology, geology, or a related field
10+ years of scientific experience, or 8+ years with an advanced degree
Strong project leadership skills, including field planning, workload management, and scientific coordination
Client-facing experience with technical proposal development and scientific presentation
Deep experience with scientific data collection, QA/QC, analysis, and reporting
Advanced knowledge in at least one and broad knowledge across several ecological or environmental scientific disciplines
Proficiency in GIS tools, scientific software, and data visualization
Experience collaborating with regulatory agencies, interpreting SOPs, and applying permitting framework
You will thrive in this position if you: 

Enjoy leading and training multidisciplinary field teams in dynamic environments
Take pride in mentoring junior staff and fostering technical growth in others
Excel at building strong client relationships and thinking strategically about project delivery
What would make you stand out?

Master’s degree or PhD in a relevant discipline
Certifications such as PWS, CWB, CERP, PG, or specialized state or federal licenses
Publication in scientific journals or leadership in professional organizations

Description
A.I.S., Inc. (AIS) is a national scientific services firm supporting maritime activities requiring certification of compliance with environmental regulations as well as collecting data for use by Federal, State, Municipal, and other government agencies along the US coastline.

AIS is looking for a Sr. Fisheries Physiologist to assist in the planning of and preparations for lab-based behavior studies with living marine resources in support of the Ecosystems and Aquaculture Division (EAD).

Primary Function:
The EAD supports research themes including the processes linking spatial and temporal patterns in climate with regional and local responses of species and their habitats. Sound originating from anthropogenic activities in the world’s oceans is increasing and so there is increased attention being paid to its ecological consequences. This is a particular concern in previously undeveloped areas of the oceans. Most of this concern has focused on the effects/impacts on marine mammal and protected species which excludes the far larger biomass and economic importance of other fish and invertebrates. Criteria and metrics employed for the use on these fishes and invertebrates have often had to be assumed and key information is lacking towards understanding disruption in such behaviors as feeding and breeding. A candidate is needed to support work towards filling these research gaps.

Duties/Responsibilities:
Leads the development and execution of advanced experimental designs, adapting as needed.
Conceives and leads large, multi-year, multi-partner research initiatives as a Co-PI and writes grant proposals, ensuring alignment with NOAA and project goals.
Supervises junior contractor staff and mentors contractor interns or volunteers.
Participates in lab experiments to collect physiological and behavioral data from fish held in research aquaria, including experience with Auditory Brainstem Response experiments using Tucker Davis Technologies System III tools and/or Loligo Systems intermittent flow respirometry equipment.
Organizes field sample collection of fish and habitat, potentially including image and genetic data.
Assists in the planning of and preparations for lab-based fish metabolism, hearing, and/or acoustic behavioral and physiological studies with living marine resources.
Calculates vital physiological rates, sound pressure, and/or particle motion stimulus intensity levels from software and/or hydrophone and geophone recordings during experiments.
Publishes research in peer-reviewed journals and co-presents at national conferences.
Builds and maintains collaborator networks to enhance project success.
 Compensation: Candidates will be paid an hourly rate to be negotiated, and total compensation will vary depending on the candidates’ depth of experience. This is a full–time position. AIS benefits package includes health and dental insurance, vacation, sick and holiday benefits. 

Minimum Qualifications:
Doctoral degree (PhD.) in Biology, Marine Science, Physiology, Neuroscience, or related fields and 5+ years of experience.
Proven experience in experimental design and statistical analysis.
Demonstrated ability to publish technical reports and peer-reviewed journal articles
Familiar with fish tagging techniques (tbar, anchor, elastomer, pit)
Basic knowledge of plumbing, valves and piping and how to connect them.
Capable and willing to do physical work in indoor/outdoor spaces, semi enclosed spaces and possible on a sea-going vessel.
Drives government vehicles (requires valid driver’s license).
Lift up to 50 lbs.
Works irregular hours, shift work, and on weekends if experiments require.

Preferred Qualifications:
Experience with spawning, husbandry, and general maintenance of marine finfish and shellfish adults and early life-stages in a captive, culture-based environment.

Travel:
Domestic and international travel may be required as follows: attendance at regional, national and international stock assessment related meetings, project-related workshops and working group meetings.

https://safariclubfoundation.org/

Hunting is an ancient tradition passed down from the earliest times of man to the present day. Hunters participate directly in the natural world and care enough to make sure that it continues in all of its awesome beauty and diversity.

Safari Club International (SCI) is a U.S.-based organization of more than 50,000 hunters and nearly 200 chapters worldwide, dedicated to protecting the right to hunt and to promote wildlife conservation. Between SCI and its sister organization, the SCI Foundation, we have put more than $70 Million on the ground for conservation since 2000. In the U.S. and abroad, hunters are part of a system that keeps the rivers, forests and fields intact and maintains the wildlife.

Safari Club International Foundation (SCIF) has a 20-year history of being a leader in science-based, research-driven solutions to real problems facing wildlife conservation and sustainable use of wildlife resources. SCIF is active in domestic and international wildlife conservation, including with CITES and the IUCN, and is the host of the annual African Wildlife Consultative Forum. We partner with leading wildlife researchers at places like the Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Auburn University, and Michigan State University to bring the latest applied techniques to wildlife conservation issues.

Summary

The Safari Club International Foundation (SCIF) is seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Fellow to support SCIF’s research on large carnivores in Africa and North America. The candidate should have a Ph.D. in wildlife ecology, quantitative ecology, statistics or related field.

SCI Foundation is engaged in donor-funded applied research with several large carnivore species, including African leopards, African lions, cougars and grizzly bears. The incumbent will lead data analyses and development of density/abundance estimation models and other ecological models (occupancy, movement) to support wildlife conservation and management decisions. The incumbent will also participate in study design and development for new projects in this area of research. This is primarily a data management and analysis position; however, the possibility of participating in field work exists. This position provides an opportunity to engage in international research and interact with a broad range of stakeholders including state, national, and international agencies, landowners and the hunting industry. The incumbent must demonstrate an understanding of, and commitment to, hunting as an essential part of biologically sound and ethically responsible international wildlife management.

The position will be based in College Station, Texas. Remote work will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  

This position is for a term of two years with the possibility of extension. Applicants must be authorized to work in the United States.

Salary and Benefits

This is a full-time, 12-month appointment, with a two-year duration and potential for extension based on funding. Salary is dependent on experience (~$60,000-65,000 per year) and includes benefits (competitive health insurance packages, paid time off and 401(k)).

Description
The Palmquist Lab at Marshall University is recruiting for an NSF funded postdoctoral research associate focused on evaluating the impacts of multiple global change drivers on dryland plant communities. Our research focuses on quantifying vegetation dynamics over space and time and identifying how the relative importance of ecological processes structuring plant communities changes with spatial and temporal scale. In addition, a key goal of our research is to understand how pattern and process in plant communities will be altered in the face of global environmental change. An important motivation for our work is to address ecological questions at large spatial scales to inform landscape conservation. We collect field data, use existing large observational data sets, and implement simulation modeling to address these goals in temperate shrublands, wetlands, woodlands, and forests. Additional information about the lab can be found at http://www.kylepalmquist.org/. 
 RESEARCH FOCUS: The successful candidate will broadly explore the interacting effects of climate change, wildfire, and livestock grazing intensity on big sagebrush plant communities throughout their spatial extent in the western US via ecological modeling. These water-limited ecosystems are undergoing rapid environmental change due to multiple stressors (climate change, increases in wildfire activity, species invasions) and represent some of the most threatened systems in North America. This project is supported by a five-year NSF CAREER grant and will leverage an individual-based plant simulation model (STEPWAT2) to quantify the impacts of multiple global change drivers on big sagebrush plant communities under future conditions. Potential focal projects include but are not limited to: investigating the role of competition in altering plant functional type responses to global change drivers and the implications for shrub-grass coexistence, identifying the likelihood of ecosystem state transitions under a future climate, and investigating how livestock grazing can be used as a tool to maintain native plant cover and prevent invasion by non-native species. This project will provide collaborative and networking opportunities with ecologists at Yale University, and with scientists and managers from multiple federal agencies (BLM, USGS, USFWS, USFS, USDA ARS). 
 REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS: 
·      A PhD in ecology or a related field with relevant course work in ecology and statistics and a demonstrated publication record in these fields
·      Knowledge of and/or experience working in sagebrush ecosystems of the western U.S.
·      Strong quantitative skills and experience in ecological modeling and computer programming in R and Unix environments
·      Excellent organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to work both independently and collaboratively in a team environment
·      Strong written and verbal communication skills
 EXPECTATIONS: The successful candidate will be expected to conduct high-quality research, present their research to the scientific community at regional and national meetings, publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and mentor undergraduate and graduate students in collaborative settings. The candidate will have the opportunity to gain additional teaching experience in the Department of Biological Sciences, at a minimum by presenting their research via guest lectures within Palmquist’s existing ecology classes (Principles of Ecology, Plant Ecology). The candidate will also be expected to participate in educational and outreach activities with Marshall University undergraduates and the Northern Arapaho tribes in Wyoming.
 TIMELINE: The position is available starting March 2026 and must be filled no later than June 2026.
 FUNDING: Funding is available for two years and five months at $55,000 per year. Full benefits (health insurance and retirement) will be provided. Funding beyond one year will be contingent on satisfactory job performance.
 LOCATION: The position will be based at Marshall University in Huntington, WV. For the right candidate, remote work may be considered.
 Marshall University is located in Huntington, an affordable college town located on the Ohio River in the beautiful state of West Virginia. The town is small enough to get around on foot and bike, but large enough to support a variety of restaurants and other cultural activities. Huntington and the surrounding area offer ample recreational opportunities (hiking, skiing, rafting), along with proximity to larger cities, including Louisville, KY, Cincinnati, OH, and Columbus, OH. In the Palmquist Lab, we highly value and encourage work-life balance. Faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences have expertise in a variety of biological fields, including but not limited to ecology, evolution, herpetology, and physiology. More information about the Department and its programs can be found here: https://www.marshall.edu/biology/.
 HOW TO APPLY: Interested individuals should apply by submitting the following to Dr. Kyle Palmquist (palmquist@marshall.edu). Please include: “Postdoc position - dryland plant communities” and your name in the email subject.
 1) cover letter describing research interests and career goals (no longer than 2 pages)
2) CV
3) unofficial transcripts
4) up to three representative peer-reviewed publications (in press or published)
5) contact information for three professional references
 Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until a candidate is selected. I strongly encourage applicants from diverse backgrounds and experiences to apply. Feel free to contact me with questions at any time.

Description
 Would you like to live in the middle of the Amazon rainforest as part of a fantastic multicultural team while helping to preserve wild macaws? Add to that learning a new set of skills and gaining great field experience at one of the longest-running parrot projects in the Americas? If this sounds good to you, come and join our team of dedicated volunteers!

For over two decades, we’ve been working in the lowlands of southeastern Peru, led by Drs. Brightsmith and Vigo-Trauco from Texas A&M’s Schubot Center for Avian Health. Our research focuses on the breeding ecology of wild parrots and macaws in Tambopata, a region critical to conservation since 1999.

Volunteers are the backbone of our work, contributing thousands of hours to understanding these incredible birds. Whether you’re passionate about wildlife, have a background in biology, or are just eager to gain field experience, we welcome you to be part of this rewarding journey.

With various programs designed for all experience levels—from birdwatching enthusiasts to graduate-level professionals—there’s an opportunity for everyone who’s responsible, enthusiastic, and ready for an adventure in conservation. Are you ready for a hands-on conservation experience in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth? Come join us in making a real difference!

We have different volunteer assistantships programs that require different levels of experience from amateur enthusiasts and birdwatchers to graduate-level professionals. Volunteer activities vary according to the position.

LONG TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT

 Join our team and be trained to identify all local parrots by sight and sound. You’ll conduct parrot censuses in the forest and at clay licks, locate foraging parrots, and enter collected data into our system. During the macaw breeding season, you’ll learn to climb trees using rope systems and observe macaw behavior around nests. Additional duties include campsite setup and cooking. 

SHORT VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT

In this role, you will receive quick training to assist our field team in monitoring macaw nests from the ground, supporting the team that works with ropes. You will also be trained to monitor macaw behavior around nests and help with clay lick observations. Due to the shorter stay, involvement in activities like parrot censuses and tree climbing will be limited. Other responsibilities include campsite setup and cooking.

SPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION

Be part of the “Harrison's Bird Foods Internship in the Rainforest Program”! You will receive comprehensive training similar to our long-term volunteers, including parrot identification, conducting censuses, monitoring foraging behaviors, tracking tree species macaws use, and entering data. In addition to tree climbing and nest observation, you’ll also assist with macaw chick health checks, including taking biometric measurements. You’ll play a key role in our nest monitoring expeditions throughout the Tambopata River basin. As with all positions, activities include campsite setup and cooking. 

QUALIFICATIONS

LONG-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS:

The first floor has a large area for common use of the different teams of researchers who stay there.

COST
Essentially, volunteering is free. We take care of research permit costs, cover the costs of all staff, work to maintain training material, and also deal with all correspondence and various aspects of project management. However, our budget does not extend to being able to pay for all aspects of volunteer participation. As such you only need to cover food, accommodation, and other services provided by the field station. The costs are very reasonable. The daily fee is according to the position and experience:

• Long-term assistant: 30 USD/day 

• Short-term assistant: 45 USD/day 

• SPONSORED Long-term assistant: NO COST (Thanks to the generous sponsorship from Harrison's Bird Foods) 


*A one-time processing fee of $30 will be added for all volunteers.
This rate covers food (3 meals per day) and accommodations (bedding is provided). All volunteers will be charged an airport transfer to be picked up ($20) or dropped off ($10) at the airport plus an extra cost to be transported to the port in private transportation ($45). Once a volunteer was accepted, they will be sent an invoice by email from Texas A&M University. Upon receipt, the volunteer needs to pay 20% of the total cost of their stay. This non-refundable payment is required to hold the reservation for the assistant. The remaining 80% of the payment should be made at least two weeks before the assistant arrives at the release site. Arrangements can be made if assistants wish to pay in cash in the country. However, prior permission from the coordinator is needed. Changes to the daily fee may apply according to availability and season

Description
Would you like to live in the middle of the Amazon rainforest as part of a fantastic multicultural team while helping to preserve wild macaws? Add to that learning a new set of skills and gaining great field experience at one of the longest-running parrot projects in the Americas? If this sounds good to you, come and join our team of dedicated volunteers!

For over two decades, we’ve been working in the lowlands of southeastern Peru, led by Drs. Brightsmith and Vigo-Trauco from Texas A&M’s Schubot Center for Avian Health. Our research focuses on the breeding ecology of wild parrots and macaws in Tambopata, a region critical to conservation since 1999.

Volunteers are the backbone of our work, contributing thousands of hours to understanding these incredible birds. Whether you’re passionate about wildlife, have a background in biology, or are just eager to gain field experience, we welcome you to be part of this rewarding journey.

With various programs designed for all experience levels—from birdwatching enthusiasts to graduate-level professionals—there’s an opportunity for everyone who’s responsible, enthusiastic, and ready for an adventure in conservation. Are you ready for a hands-on conservation experience in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth? Come join us in making a real difference!

We have different volunteer assistantships programs that require different levels of experience from amateur enthusiasts and birdwatchers to graduate-level professionals. Volunteer activities vary according to the position.

LONG TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT

 Join our team and be trained to identify all local parrots by sight and sound. You’ll conduct parrot censuses in the forest and at clay licks, locate foraging parrots, and enter collected data into our system. During the macaw breeding season, you’ll learn to climb trees using rope systems and observe macaw behavior around nests. Additional duties include campsite setup and cooking. 

SHORT VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT

In this role, you will receive quick training to assist our field team in monitoring macaw nests from the ground, supporting the team that works with ropes. You will also be trained to monitor macaw behavior around nests and help with clay lick observations. Due to the shorter stay, involvement in activities like parrot censuses and tree climbing will be limited. Other responsibilities include campsite setup and cooking. 

SPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION

Be part of the “Harrison's Bird Foods Internship in the Rainforest Program”! You will receive comprehensive training similar to our long-term volunteers, including parrot identification, conducting censuses, monitoring foraging behaviors, tracking tree species macaws use, and entering data. In addition to tree climbing and nest observation, you’ll also assist with macaw chick health checks, including taking biometric measurements. You’ll play a key role in our nest monitoring expeditions throughout the Tambopata River basin. As with all positions, activities include campsite setup and cooking.

Description
The lab of Urban Plant Ecology at Cornell University is seeking a postdoctoral researcher to lead research projects. This work will primarily involve conducting large-scale data synthesis projects to better understand the drivers of urban metacommunities and biodiversity patterns. In particular, the lab is interested in understanding the drivers of biotic heterogeneity in urban environments and the spatial/temporal dynamics of these drivers. This will involve working with pre-existing data collected by the lab, as well as collaborator data and publicly available data from an array of cities. As such, the postdoc should have strong experience working with large datasets, modeling ecological data, and maintaining national/international collaborations. The postdoc will have a relatively high degree of autonomy in developing research projects and directions, in concert with Aaron Sexton, lab PI. If interested, the postdoc could also join in data collection in ongoing field research projects, but this will not encompass a majority of the researcher’s time. Opportunities exist for informal mentoring of graduate and undergraduate research students. Start date is expected to be November 2025. This position will be located in Ithaca, New York with the potential of working a hybrid schedule, depending on needs.

The participant can be based at any member institution of the SW CASC University Consortium (University of Arizona; Northern Arizona University; University of Nevada, Las Vegas; Utah State University; University of California, Davis; University of California, Los Angeles; Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California, San Diego).

The USGS mission is to monitor, analyze, and predict current and evolving dynamics of complex human and natural Earth-system interactions and to deliver actionable intelligence at scales and timeframes relevant to decision makers. As the Nation's largest water, earth, and biological science and civilian mapping agency, USGS collects, monitors, analyzes, and provides science about natural resource conditions, issues, and problems.

The SW CASC delivers useful and useable science to natural and cultural resource managers so that they can plan for climate adaptation. Invasive species have long been a problem in the Southwest. There is growing awareness that climate change influences the spread of invasive species, and that invasive species can interact with climate change, exacerbating impacts. The SW CASC is interested working with natural and cultural resource managers to identify and meet regional research, education and communication needs related to invasive species and climate change.

Research Project: A research opportunity is available with the Southwest Climate Adaptation Science Center (SW CASC). Regional CASCs deliver science to support climate adaptation by natural and cultural resource managers. The selected candidate will be based at a SW CASC University Consortium member institution and will be mentored by university faculty and US Geological Survey staff.

With guidance, specific activities may include, but are not limited to:

Conducting research on climate change and invasive species, including ecological or social science research.

Regional Invasive Species & Climate Change (RISCC) Management Networks in the Southwest and elsewhere in the US.
Translating scientific information for distribution to resource managers or other interested audiences.
Learning Objectives: Participants will learn about:

Conducting user-engaged science
Invasive species concerns and management approaches in the Southwest, and;
Science communication and translation
Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Stephanie McAfee (smcafee@usgs.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: August 15, 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be renewed upon recommendation of DOI and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is part time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience.

Description
We are looking for a Wildlife Biologist to join our team and tackle complex ecological challenges across California.

At WRA, you'll play a key role in supporting a wide range of projects—from ecological restoration and open space management to water and wastewater infrastructure and climate resiliency initiatives. While our work spans the state, this role will primarily focus on projects in the San Francisco Bay and Estuary.

Your work will take you from the coastal salt marshes of the Bay and Pacific Coast, to the grasslands and vernal pools of the Central Valley, and into the Sierra Nevada mountains. As a mid-level professional, we're looking for someone who is motivated, intellectually curious, and eager to learn from our team of experienced biologists. We are especially interested in candidates with experience working with special-status species and a passion for encountering some of the rarest wildlife in the continental United States—while continuing to grow both technically and as a project manager.

You will lead and conduct fieldwork, perform data analysis, and prepare technical reports to support regulatory compliance for restoration, development, and infrastructure efforts. The ideal candidate brings experience with field assessments, permitting with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), as well as impacts and mitigation evaluations for CEQA and other regulatory approvals.

To be considered for this role, candidates must reside within approximately 45 minutes of our San Rafael, Emeryville, and Petaluma offices. This proximity ensures you can actively contribute to our collaborative team environment and be available for local field site visits as needed.

In this role, you will:
Manage preparation of biological technical reports, restoration/mitigation monitoring reports and species-specific survey reports with oversight and guidance from senior team members 
Conduct CEQA analyses focused on biological resources, including existing condition evaluations, impact assessments, and mitigation recommendations, for IS/MNDs and EIRs
Make ecological management recommendations based on results of ecological surveys and monitoring data
Conduct and lead field surveys for various species and engage with other WRA staff to lead multi-disciplinary field efforts
Collaborate with other technical staff (e.g., biologists, wetland delineators, arborists, GIS specialists) and sub-consultants (e.g., archaeologists, historians) in the completion of technical studies (desktop or field-based)
Work with engineers to review their designs to help avoid and minimize impacts to regulated species, protected aquatic resources and other sensitive areas
Prepare environmental permit applications and technical documents to support inter-agency consultations (e.g., Section 7 of the Federal Endangered Species Act)
Prepare letters, reports, and/or memorandums, which may include detailing results of surveys or assessments
Apply your understanding of the regulatory permitting environment in California to projects
Evaluate project sites for jurisdictional streams and wetlands as well as habitat for special-status species
Collaborate closely with WRA’s senior regulatory permitting specialists and CEQA/NEPA planners to develop environmental scopes of work and budgets
Build and apply skills needed to interact directly with clients and regulatory agencies to manage projects 

To be successful in this role, you will need: 

A Bachelor's or Master's degree in Ecology, Biology, or other Natural Resources-related field
3 years of consulting experience, including direct experience in the identification and ecology of Northern or Southern California wildlife and habitats
Technical knowledge of California's wildlife species, habitats, and applicable state and federal regulations
Experience substantially assisting project managers, and a desire to be mentored in managing WRA’s environmental work
Direct experience working multiple projects and tasks; able to determine project and task urgency in a practical way
Direct experience with aquatic resources permitting and endangered species permitting
Direct experience handling logistics for remote fieldwork (e.g., travel, lodging, equipment, scheduling staff)
Experience in CEQA/NEPA wildlife review and analysis, restoration project land management, and compliance with state and federal requirements during and after project construction
A knack for working independently as well as harmoniously with others
A baseline understanding of Geographic Positioning Systems (GPS) mapping 
To be organized and practice attention to detail
Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite programs (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and G-Suite (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Drive, Calendar, etc.)
A valid driver’s license and reliable transportation (while WRA has fleet vehicles that can be reserved for field use, during busy field seasons a truck may not always be available)
The ability to walk, hike, and work outside for long periods of time
Willingness to learn and participate in tasks outside the specific job role

WRA has an established internal leveling system for our staff that maps to salary bands that have been informed by market data. Our leveling system is dependent on years of relevant industry experience, education, and the level of responsibility and autonomy at which you’re expected to operate.

The salary range for this position is $85,000 - $110,000 which represents 2 job levels that WRA is open to considering for this role. In your first conversation with our recruiter, we will discuss leveling and compensation with you to make sure that expectations are aligned. 

Who are we?
WRA’s an employee-owned environmental consultancy. We are a tenacious team of planners, engineers, and scientists, and we aim to leave the lands we love better than we found them.

LANDSCAPE PLANNING

COURSE DESCRIPTION -  Conservation planning happens at multiple scales from site-specific to transcontinental. While all conservation actions on the ground must eventually be applied at the site scale, the “landscape-scale” has been recommended for decades as a suitable scale for planning. The landscape scale brings in ecological and socioeconomic context to inform decisions by understanding ecological connections and flows, population-level information about species, human stressors affecting sites but originating outside of them, and policy. This course will explore the key concepts and some tricky challenges of conducting conservation planning at the landscape scale, including how site-scale implementing actions can flow from a landscape-scale plan.  The course will draw on the Conservation Standards and other frameworks but will address the multi-disciplinary needs and tools of landscape planning including spatial analyses and optimization, incorporating socioeconomic factors and community input, the importance of partners, and how to sustain what must be a dynamic effort into the future. Eight guest instructors from multiple organizations around the world will augment the course with their specific expertise and experience.

Description
WRA is seeking a Landscape Architecture Director to lead our Landscape Architecture Group within our interdisciplinary Riverscapes and Shorelines Team. The desired candidate will collaborate and engage both internally and externally to lead, support, and deliver a diverse range of design projects focused primarily on ecological restoration, with the capability to support parks and open space and community resilience projects as needed.  

You will join our team of restoration design professionals and scientists, including engineers, landscape architects, fluvial geomorphologists, hydrologists, and ecologists. Our projects span a variety of ecosystems and types across California including San Francisco Bay tidal marshes and living shorelines, Sierra Nevada meadow restoration, Northern California Coast floodplain and salmonid restoration, California Central Coast estuary restoration, and Bay Area and Southern California urban stream rehabilitation. Additionally, our team is actively growing and pursuing restoration work in Oregon. We are passionate about restoring riverine and coastal systems that support healthy and resilient natural and human communities, and are invested in the entire restoration process from initial site selection to performance monitoring and adaptive management. We also frequently collaborate with our parks and open space and community resilience teams to integrate ecological restoration with recreation and educational opportunities such as trails, gathering spaces, and interpretive features, as well as tackling challenges such as sea-level rise and wildfire resiliency.

WRA has a diverse portfolio of projects and clients, including decades-long private clients, public agencies, and non-profit organizations. In addition to our technical expertise, we help clients meet their goals and visions by providing grant fund cultivation, preparing financial models, partnering with investors, engaging stakeholders, and facilitation services. 

We envision you working in-person at one of our San Francisco Bay Area offices or in a hybrid arrangement or remote location in this region of California. Other locations may be considered on a case by case basis. Regardless of your work arrangement, in-person, remote, or hybrid, you will be excited to collaborate with staff in many technical disciplines across the company.

At WRA, you will have 3 major areas of impact:

Technical Skills:
Provide guidance on the design strategy for seasonal wetland, tidal wetland, river, and riparian restoration projects
Oversee the production of conceptual plans, construction drawings, technical specifications, and cost estimates for use in all design phases.
Apply knowledge of California native plant communities, soils, hydrology, and construction in restoration planning and design.
Provide construction administration and management services, including field observation of grading, planting, and other landscape design components.

Leadership:
Utilize restoration experience to provide technical oversight of restoration conceptual plans, construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, and relevant soil and hydrologic analyses.
Mentor landscape architects and designers in grading, planting, irrigation, and restoration design using AutoCAD and Civil 3D software.
Oversee project managers and design staff to ensure work quality and that projects meet budgets and deadlines.
Foster collaboration within an interdisciplinary team.

Business Development:
Develop regional recognition through networking and events, such as attending and presenting at conferences.
Advise clients on project issues to build business.
Lead and support new proposal efforts.

To be successful in this role, you will need: 

To be currently licensed as a Landscape Architect in the U.S. with the ability to obtain California licensure within 6 months of hiring.  
Minimum of 10 years’ experience providing landscape architectural services with demonstrated success designing and implementing seasonal wetland, tidal wetland, river and/or riparian restoration.  
Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in landscape architecture at a university or college that is accredited by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board.
Strong written and verbal communication abilities.  
A passion for ecological restoration and connecting people from diverse backgrounds and locations with the outdoors and open spaces. 
Familiarity with California ecosystems and regulatory environment.
Experience supervising and mentoring junior staff. 
Experience developing a portfolio of work.
A valid driver’s license and reliable transportation (while WRA has fleet vehicles that can be reserved for field use, during busy field seasons a truck may not be available).

WRA has an established internal leveling system for our staff that maps to salary bands that have been informed by market data. Our leveling system is dependent on years of relevant industry experience, education, and the level of responsibility and autonomy at which you’re expected to operate.

We have posted a salary range that corresponds to the appropriate level for this position. In your first conversation with our recruiter, we will discuss leveling and compensation with you to make sure that our expectations are aligned. 

*The salary range for this position is $120,000-$172,000 which represents 2 job levels that WRA is open to considering for this role. Additionally, while the position is being advertised as a Landscape Architecture Director, based on leveling conversations, we may determine that Senior Landscape Architect is the appropriate title for you. There will be opportunities to discuss this toward the end of the interview process; however, if you wish to discuss titles earlier in the interview process, please do so in your initial interview. 

Who are we?
WRA’s an employee-owned environmental consultancy. We are a tenacious team of planners, engineers, and scientists, and we aim to leave the lands we love better than we found them.

   Comfortable accommodation will be provided during your stay.

Transportation: Pick-up from and drop-off at the Polokwane airport, weekly or bi-weekly town trips for students to restock supplies, and daily drives around the reserve.

This fee ensures that your experience contributes to both your well-being and the vital work of preserving the reserve.

Duration of Stay:  
Flexible | We recommend a commitment of 2 to 4 months to fully immerse yourself in the experience.

In 2023 and 2024, LHIP interns expanded on the earlier successes by creating public programs for local festivals, libraries, and summer camps. These efforts also included forming partnerships with community organizations such as ALASI and Carnival Latino. With 29% of the population of Huntingburg, Indiana (approximately 11 miles north of the park) identifying as Hispanic or Latino, LIBO’s 2025 interns will focus on developing audience-centered experiences primarily geared toward Spanish speakers and updating the park's educational and interpretive materials.

Potential Programs:

Exploring Southern Indiana nature.

Learning about pioneer life and Abraham Lincoln’s time in Southern Indiana.

Providing on-site living history farm tours and Visitor Center exploration activities.

Community Engagement:
Throughout the summer, interns will work to:

Conduct outreach with the Latinx community, particularly in the Huntingburg area.

Expand existing programs.

Re-establish connections with local Latinx audiences.

Hosting LHIP interns in 2025 is a critical step in LIBO’s effort to create continuity in its outreach initiatives with the local Latinx community.

Application Due: ASAP

The Latino Heritage Internship Program (LHIP) seeks to engage undergraduates and recent graduates ages 18 - 30, and up to 35 for veterans, for this unmatched leadership training program that is focused in the cultural and natural resource management. You must be (additional requirement):

You must be a U.S. citizen or legal resident.

A drivers license is required for this position.

*A personal vehicle is preferred for this position.

 

Position Description: 


The LHIP intern will contribute to the National Park Service (NPS) and Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area’s (DEWA) mission by providing resource-based recreation, education, and enjoyment near the most densely populated region of the nation. The intern will have three central projects while serving at DEWA.

Bilingual Public Programs:
The first project is to build upon previous programmatic and community engagement successes by providing at least four bilingual public programs throughout the summer. A fluent Spanish-speaking visitor services presence is a significant need at the park and would greatly increase outreach to Latino visitors. DEWA staff have developed and initiated a very popular waterfall walk along an accessible trail, which would be an excellent opportunity for the intern to present to Spanish-speaking groups. Topics may include watersheds, migrations, adaptations, forest forensics, and more!

Translating Park Publications:
The second project for the Latino Heritage Intern would be to translate park publications and maps from English to Spanish. This would allow park rangers who are not bilingual to provide Spanish-speaking visitors with appropriate information for a safe and enjoyable visit.

River and Beach Access Sites:
The third project is to improve access to popular river and beach sites within the park by providing orientation, water safety information, and audience-centered interpretation to groups. The intern will be given time and support to develop pop-up programs, beach programs, and/or an introductory Spanish-language Junior Ranger Program to engage families in lessons and activities about river safety. (Over the past three years, there have been five visitor drownings at DEWA, with 40% of the victims speaking Spanish as their first language.)

Additionally, DEWA is partnering with Latino Outdoors, Outdoor Afro, and NPCA to provide guided hikes. The Latino Heritage Intern would prepare for the hikes with the park’s supervisory ranger and have the opportunity to coordinate, lead, and strengthen visitor relationships with resources and recreational opportunities. Interns will also collaborate with seasonal employees, partners, volunteers, and supervisory staff to attend community programs and outreach events with the goal of reaching Spanish-speaking visitors.

 

Responsibilities:

 Fluency in Spanish
Interest in embracing new opportunities
Willingness to develop and build self-awareness
 

Qualifications:

Educational/Experience Requirements:

At least two years of coursework toward a degree in biological sciences or two years of field experience related to natural resource/vegetation work
One semester of coursework related to geospatial data
Clearance:

Government security background clearance required before starting
Work Abilities:

Ability to work productively both independently and as part of a team
Effective communication with team members, agency staff, and a diverse public
Physical ability to:
Hike up to 10 miles daily on uneven terrain with a pack
Work in harsh and rapidly changing environments
Traverse uneven terrain and carry up to 40 pounds in a backpack
Maintain good physical condition
Fieldwork Requirements:

Willingness to spend multiple days camping in the field, as needed
Organizational Skills:

Stations: Toucan Ridge Ecology and Education Society (T.R.E.E.S) 
Location: 27.5 miles Hummingbird Highway, Stann Creek 
Country: Belize, Central America 
 Description: 
The T.R.E.E.S Farm has been established as a Farm-to-Table organic operation and regenerative agriculture demonstration farm. Its primary purpose is to serve the original needs of the NGO’s operations which are wildlife conservation through research and education. This is accomplished through the layout of the farm which provides extensive wildlife habitat and foraging opportunities, increasing the local faunal biodiversity as well as acting as an educational demonstration to local subsistence farmers and visiting students.  
Interns will learn by assisting in implementation and evaluation of management practices, cropping, and record keeping on the farm with this vision in mind while we endeavor to maximize the products coming from the farm with the existing design and layout using sustainable and regenerative practices specific to the Mesoamerican uplands. Within this broad framework, intern projects can include several basic Agricultural Education disciplines including Tropical Agriculture, Sustainable/organic Agriculture, Farm Management, Waste management, and Agricultural Economics.  
In addition to planting crops, we also have free range chickens and ducks for eggs and meat. We are looking to increase our revenue generation from the farm either in the form of increased accountable products entering our kitchen for use in our restaurant, or for sale to the Mobile Market or in a proposed road-side café which would be managed by T.R.E.E.S kitchen and hospitality staff. Thus, interns would also assist us with marketing strategy for existing products and/or planting. 
By the successful conclusion of this internship, the student will be able to apply practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species, basic free range poultry operations, evaluate different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns, and become familiar with sustainable management practices such as no/low till, cover cropping, waste management, mulching, marketing, Farm-to-Table, etc. 
 Requirements: 
No prior tropical agriculture experience required. Interns can be current undergraduate or graduate students enrolled in a program with their University/College for credit however non-students can also apply; but preference will be given to students enrolled in an accreditation program.

 Internship Responsibilities: 
Applying practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species and basic free range poultry operations. 
Evaluating different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns. 
Work on Inga Alley-cropping and other regenerative cropping practices, and using intercropping, organic fertilizing and pest control practices. 
Assist with innovative marketing strategies for existing products accompanied by reviewing projected budgets for the farm and their products and exploring cost/profit ratios for poultry husbandry. 
Planting and selling new products for the farm. 
Opportunities are also available to observe and participate with concurrent intern and wildlife educational activities such as mist-netting, observing and recording measurements of bats, birds, herps, invertebrates, water quality, and much more. 
Interns will assist with creating captions for social media posts to engage and update followers on what has been going on at the field station and various projects that are being done. 
 Internship Period: 
Interns can choose to do a minimum of 2 weeks to a maximum of 5 weeks during this Apprenticeship program, though 4 weeks is the recommended duration. 
 Costs: 
This internship has a fee of $184 USD/week which includes room and board (meals included Monday-Friday), full access to lab equipment, and training by professional on-site biologists. Food is not provided as part of the internship program. Interns can also purchase their own basic food supplies from nearby vendors that can be prepared simply on-site without access to a full kitchen OR interns can order meals from the on-site Toucan Café restaurant that is open daily and caters to all dietary restrictions Lodging at the research center signifies a shared dormitory-style rustic cabins with other same sex interns with full access to other facilities such as showers, restrooms, and kitchen.

Interns are required to work for 35 hours/week minimum. The typical schedule runs from Monday through Friday, from 6:30 am until 12:30 pm and 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm. Weekends are free time for interns; therefore, you can do as please (travel, hike, relax). No refunds on food and lodging will be available if the intern decides to leave the station. Projects may sometimes run into the weekend; in which case the days will be returned to them during the week.  
The intern supervisor(s) will be responsible for designing a schedule with the intern each week that is reasonable and includes work on the various projects.

Description
At RES, we’re looking for purpose-driven individuals who are passionate about restoration and sustainability, and who want their work to make a lasting environmental impact. Our team members go above and beyond, bringing initiative, integrity, and a strong work ethic to every project. Collaboration is key—we thrive on teamwork, open communication, and diverse perspectives. In a field that constantly changes, we value those who are resilient, adaptable, and resourceful in the face of challenges. If you're intellectually curious, eager to learn, and ready to help restore ecosystems and protect natural resources, you’ll find your place here.

RES is looking for a Scientist I to join our team.

As a Scientist I at RES, you’ll support field data collection, environmental monitoring, and ecological assessments that provide the foundation of our environmental, ecological, and natural resource projects. Working under the direction of experienced scientists, you’ll contribute to meaningful work in the field—collecting and processing data, supporting and reporting field efforts, and gaining exposure to environmental regulations, ecosystems, and scientific practices.

This position is an entry-level opportunity ideal for a recent graduate or someone early in their career who is passionate about environmental science, ecology, or natural resources and wants to build a strong foundation for long-term growth.

This position is based in our Fort Lauderdale, FL office, and the selected candidate is expected to work from the office via a hybrid schedule. Some travel and overnight stays are anticipated. Approximately 60-70% of your time will be spent in the field, supporting projects across South and Central Florida.

Why You’ll Love This Job

 

You’ll be in the field, not just behind a desk. Whether you’re taking soil samples, surveying stream banks, or recording vegetation data, you’ll see firsthand Florida's varied ecosystems.

You’ll build real-world scientific skills. From GPS data collection to interpreting maps and recording results, you'll apply and expand your environmental knowledge daily.

You’ll grow with mentorship. You’ll work side-by-side with senior scientists, field leads, and project managers who are invested in helping you learn and succeed.

Your work will have an impact. Incorporation of high-quality environmental data early in a project will help facilitate decisions that incorporate environmental concepts such as avoidance and minimization.

 

A Day in the Life

Your day might start prepping field gear at the office to visit a project site— a wetland mitigation site, shallow marine habitat, or upland tree area, for example. On-site you may walk transects through a wetland, record plant species, conduct a marine benthic survey, and use a GPS to mark key locations. You’ll work as part of a small field team, following sampling protocols, maintaining equipment, and ensuring every data point is accurate and well-documented. Later, you might return to the office to enter your data into Excel or another database, help process site photos and maps, or contribute notes for a technical report.

You’ll learn how environmental regulations influence what we do, and begin to understand how habitat, water quality, landscape features and habitats intersect with project planning. Over time, you’ll become more familiar with regional flora and fauna, permitting frameworks, and real-world application of scientific principles in the field.

 

We would like to talk to you if you have many of the following:

Bachelor’s degree in environmental science, biology, ecology, geology, natural resources, or a related field
0–2 years of field experience (can include internships, academic fieldwork, or volunteer work)
Basic knowledge of scientific methods, data collection using GPS and/ or GIS tools, and safe field practices
Familiarity with ecological concepts such as native species, soil profiles, or hydrology
Ability and desire to work outdoors in varying conditions and terrain
Open-water diving certification
You will thrive in this position if you:

Possess strong verbal and written communication skills for reporting and data documentation
Have attention to detail and a commitment to high-quality data collection
Have strong work ethic and reliability in team-based fieldwork
What would make you stand out? 

Exposure to wetland, stream, marine, or habitat assessments
ArcGIS experience
Experience with field sampling equipment, inventories, or monitoring protocols
Understanding of regional environmental regulations and permitting
 

Please note that the “Day in the Life” section is not intended to be an exhaustive list of job duties, but rather a representative snapshot of typical responsibilities and work experiences at RES.

RES is an Equal Opportunity Employer and a VEVRAA Federal Contractor. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.

 BEAR CONSERVATION SPECIALIST


 Teton Country


The Wildlife Restoration Foundation (WRF) Bear Conservation Specialist-Teton Country position is open to qualified individuals passionate about bears and based near Victor, Driggs, Tetonia, and other towns along the Caribou-Targhee National Forest. The position is unpaid, but stipends are available to cover expenses and to reward accomplishments. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will rapidly gain valuable professional experience by playing an integral role on the WRF team. Work to build WRF’s bear conservation capacity and impact on Teton National Park bears as you contribute and strengthen your conservation knowledge and skills. Gain recognition for your efforts among area partners, on the WRF website, and elsewhere, as you participate in meeting WRF’s mission, which is to increase park wildlife population viability both ex situ and in situ, working closely with National Parks and Forests, zoo partners, and park gateway communities.


WRF operates effectively and efficiently and generates resources that enable measurable, boots-on-the-ground conservation results. The WRF Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will focus on implementation of the “I Am Bear Safe” Project in small towns neighboring Teton National Park’s gateway communities in Montana. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will collaborate with the WRF President, Director of Communications, and other team members in connection to the “I Am Bear Safe” Project.


 [https://www.wildlifeandparks.org/projects].


“I Am Bear Safe”™ (IABS) is a multi-partner Wildlife Coexistence Strategy designed to equip National Park gateway community chambers of commerce and their member businesses (“Park Gateway Partners”) to “train people not to train bears” to get in the trouble they are in now because of human behavior—a situation that is assuring bear demise. Bears are a top attraction at many National Parks and are well-managed within the parks to avoid human interaction. But communities at the park’s edge are not sufficiently prepared or equipped for the increasing pressure of more visitors coupled with rapid development, naïve new residents, and a growing number of recreationists in bear country. Park Gateway Partner (PGP) businesses are the perfect intervention point and receive marketing benefits from participating in the IABS town-based bear stewardship effort. WRF provides customized tools (signage and SWAG) that equip PGPs to effectively intercept park visitors and recreationists and equip them to be bear stewards who act responsibly by securing attractants and following park rules for recreating in bear habitat. The IABS goal is that bears perform their natural behaviors and survive without risk and distraction caused by humans.


Responsibilities:

Track the inventory of IABS materials distributed to PGPs in each town.
Distribute IABS Toolkit materials to PGPs and redistribution points.

Law Clerk Program

Summer 2026 Law Clerkships will accept applications from July through Labor Day 2025.


About Us


Founded in 1971, Earthjustice has a distinguished track record of achieving significant, lasting environmental protections. We achieve this by hiring people who share a passion for justice and a healthy environment. We wield the power of law and the strength of partnership to protect people’s health; preserve magnificent places and wildlife; advance clean energy; and combat climate change. We partner with thousands of groups and supporters to take on the biggest, most precedent-setting cases across the country and have a distinguished track record of achieving significant, lasting environmental protections. We are here because the earth needs a good lawyer.


Earthjustice’s work is currently divided into three major areas:

Lands, Wildlife, and Oceans focuses on cases that protect endangered species, national forests, national parks, other public lands, water resources, and the oceans.
Healthy Communities focuses on cases that protect public health, prevent air and water pollution, and curb exposures to toxic chemicals, particularly in disproportionately impacted communities. Recently, our healthy communities work has also begun to promote sustainable food and agriculture and the rights of farm workers.
Climate and Energy focuses on cases that encourage the swift and just transition to clean energy while challenging the reliance on coal, oil, and other dirty fuels.

We welcome all interested law students from across the country to apply for a summer law clerk position. We expect that students will work proximate to or in an office where the program is located. In some limited instances, an office may hire clerks to work in an area that is outside that team’s geographic area, but still proximate to an Earthjustice office.


Please note the location preferences of each litigation team in their descriptions below.


Responsibilities


Summer law clerks will have the opportunity to work with several attorneys on case development and litigation strategy. Students may draft pleadings and briefs, do legal research, develop strategy and legal theories, gather evidence, and attend client meetings and court proceedings. Earthjustice’s summer law clerk program also includes various programmatic offerings, such as in-person and virtual seminars with attorneys and guest speakers on current environmental issues, interactions with other local and regional environmental groups, and a job interview workshop.


Compensation


Earthjustice summer law clerkships are paid positions. The total stipend amount will be dependent on any external funding a student secures, such as through their law school’s summer funding program. Earthjustice will provide a one-time stipend at the start of the clerkship in the amount of $1,320.00 per week, minus the total amount received from any other sources and applicable taxes. The summer law clerkship is designed to be 10 weeks long at full-time hours (37.5 hours/week).


You are welcome to pursue outside funding. The ability to secure outside funding will not be considered as part of the hiring process.


How to Apply


Eligibility: Candidates must be enrolled in a U.S. law school through fall 2026 (i.e., not graduating before December 2026) and be available to commit to 10 weeks during summer 2026. Summer law clerks must work from the U.S. during their clerkship.


Each Earthjustice litigation team participates in clerk hiring; candidates may submit applications to whichever and however many litigation teams they are interested. Please be prepared to respond to our September follow-up e-mail, requesting your ranked choice of the teams for which you have applied. Do not include such rankings within your Jobvite application.

JOB TITLE:   Field Technician

JOB PURPOSE:  We are seeking technicians to work on a research project on Oʻahu, Hawai’i as part of the Hawai’i V.I.N.E. (Vertebrate Introductions and Novel Ecosystems) project, a collaboration across multiple universities (UH Manoa, UW, NAU, and UIUC) that began in 2014. The project is investigating temporal changes in seed dispersal and how removal of dominant invasive plants alters seed dispersal in mesic and wet forest ecosystems. Native species extinctions and non-native species introductions have dramatically changed the forest species composition. Although many native plants depend on birds for seed dispersal, on Oʻahu there are no longer any native frugivorous birds to provide this function. Instead, a suite of non-native birds are dispersing seeds. Additionally, invasive plants often dominate seed dispersal networks with impacts to native plant seed dispersal. Understanding temporal changes and how removal of invasive plant species impacts seed dispersal is critically important for restoration efforts.

There are multiple positions open with starting dates spanning August to November, with a minimum of a five-month commitment. 

ESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:  Basic duties include: (1) conducting mist-netting of birds to collect fecal samples for diet analysis, (2) performing point counts for bird abundance, (3) bird and plant ID, (4) measuring fruit abundance, (5) measuring vegetation characteristics, (6) removing access to non-native fruit, and (7) deploying game cameras. Additional duties will include: (1) regularly checking and maintaining netting and other experimental setups, (2) ensuring accurate and consistent data recording and entry, (3) collaborating with team members for data analysis and interpretation, and (4) participating in team meetings and contributing to project planning and adjustments. Additionally, applicants will be expected to participate in regular (at least monthly) outreach and education events related to the project. 

The candidate(s) selected for this position will work on a field crew of 6-9 people including other technicians, crew leader, and graduate students. Technicians must be able to work early mornings in rugged terrain in challenging field conditions. Fieldwork will involve long days of hiking and temperamental weather conditions. This is a full-time position and technicians will receive effective compensation of $14/hour, plus shared access to vehicles and the option to live in crew housing. Further details will be provided during interviews. Applicants will be responsible for their flight to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL) in Honolulu, Hawaii.

QUALIFICATIONS: Minimum: A bachelor’s degree in biology, natural resources, wildlife management, botany, ecology or a related field and field experience pertaining to wildlife biology or botany are required. Applicants must be responsible, organized, and comfortable living and working as a team. An enthusiasm for research and fieldwork is essential, as well as patience and a strong work ethic. Valid driver's license with a motor vehicle record (MVR) that is compliant with the University Vehicle Use Policy. Desired: Preference will be given to applicants with experience in tropical ecosystems, avian ecology, plant ecology, and/or a demonstrated knowledge of Hawaiian plants. 

REQUIRED MATERIALS: Complete the online application. Applications must include a cover letter, curriculum vitae, and contact information (email and phone) for 3 references familiar with your field work experience as a single PDF document. Review of applications will begin June 9, 2025. Applications for this round of hiring will not be accepted after September 1, 2025. In your cover letter, please specify your desired start date. Include details of any prior experience in bird banding, such as the approximate number of birds you have banded and extracted. Additionally, highlight any experience with plant identification and/or systematic vegetation surveys.

Description
Florida International University (FIU) and Everglades National Park (ENP) seek a postdoctoral researcher.

Duration: 2.5 years
Start date: Open until filled
Annual Salary: $61,000 - $64,000 (+ benefits package)
Location: Flexible (If in person, the position is based in Miami, FL)

About the position: FIU and the National Park Service’s South Florida Natural Resources Center (SFNRC) seek a talented and enthusiastic postdoctoral researcher with excellent quantitative skills to lead research aimed at gaining a comprehensive understanding of the resilience of Everglades recreational fisheries to hydroclimatic variation and extreme events. Recreational fishing is a core socioeconomic activity in the region, with 1 in 5 Florida anglers fishing the coastal Everglades and generating billions in economic activity. Yet, our understanding of the patterns of recreational catch and effort and their dependency on hydrology, including ongoing restoration efforts, and climate remains limited.

Coastal fisheries are hypothesized to respond to both press and pulse disturbances, with pulse disturbances impacting recruitment events and press disturbances regulating overall population performance. Thus, the goals of the study, using fisheries dependent an environmental data, are threefold: 1) To examine spatiotemporal patterns in angler catch and effort in the Everglades recreational fishery, 2) To link these spatiotemporal trends to hydroclimatic drivers and restoration actions, and 3) To evaluate the utility of fisheries-dependent data and provide recommendations for future monitoring. Available data sets include a dockside angler survey that spans over 40 years and is one of the longest and most valuable fisheries-dependent datasets in Florida, along with hydrological and climate data streams.

The position provides a unique opportunity to work collaboratively in an academic institution-government agency partnership with the goal of increasing our understanding of coastal processes and restoration effects and of improving recreational fisheries management. We are part of a highly collaborative South Florida research community, composed of scientists, federal, state, private partners, and stakeholders (see http://fcelter.fiu.edu/ and https://crestcache.fiu.edu/), and thus opportunities for collaborative team science, participation in other projects, engagement with resource managers and anglers, and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students are available.

Requirements: A Ph.D. in ecology, fisheries, quantitative ecology, biology, or related field is required. Applicants must have a demonstrated record of publication in peer-reviewed journals, and excellent coding skills in R. The selected candidate must pass a U.S. government tier 1 (non-sensitive) background check and complete NPS cybersecurity training. This position requires frequent in-person work at both FIU and NPS offices in Miami, FL.

Preferred qualifications: The ideal candidate has excellent quantitative skills and a passion for fisheries. Experience and interest working with fisheries-dependent data, robust causation analytical approaches, stock assessment tools, using collaborative team science approaches, and engagement with anglers and resource managers are desired.

How To Apply: Please email Dr. Jenn Rehage at rehagej@fiu.edu and Dr. Rolando Santos rsantosc@fiu.edu with the subject line ‘Postdoc 2025 + your name.’ In your email, please include (as a single PDF):
- Cover letter describing experience, interests & expertise relevant to position & career goals
- CV with list of 3 references
- Examples of products (peer-reviewed publications, data & code packages, GitHub repositories, popular articles, outreach products, etc.)

Description
Centro de Rescate de Especies Marinas Amenazadas (CREMA) operates a multifaceted approach for the conservation of endangered marine species at several beaches Southern Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. In our sea turtle nesting program, which opens annually during the Olive Ridley nesting season (June – January), we conduct beach monitoring (night patrols and morning censuses), nest relocations into project hatcheries, environmental education activities, and help on the environmental awareness with the local and international community, that also helps on generating job opportunities for the locals and promoting sustainable tourism development. Olive Ridleys (Lepidochelys olivacea) is the most frequent and main species that nest on these beaches, but there is also sporadic nesting of Green (Chelonia mydas), Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), and Hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) sea turtles. Egg poaching is a major threat to the nesting sea turtles on these beaches. Secondary threats include nest predation, plastic pollution, beach development and erosion, and tourist traffic. On the beaches, CREMA directs all our efforts to prevent and ultimately decrease these threats.
We operate a multifaceted approach for the conservation of sea turtles, including; applying several scientific methodologies on field, conduct beach patrols, hatchery management, conduct climate change impact protocols, develop environmental education activities, and awareness with the local community, generating job opportunities for the locals, and promoting sustainable tourism development.

 Emergency Response – APHIS is an emergency response agency.  This means that all Agency employees may be asked or assigned to participate in rotating temporary duty assignments to support emergency programs at some time during their careers with APHIS.  It is difficult to predict the frequency with which such emergency situations may occur – and could range from several emergencies in a year to none over the course of many years.  In the event that you are called upon to support an emergency program, this may require irregular working hours, including overtime, and may include duties other than those specified in your official position description.  While some emergency program support assignments may be able to be performed at the employee’s current duty station, in other cases employees may be asked to go on-site to a temporary duty state location.  In addition, it may be necessary for employees to participate in multiple rotations to an emergency program assignment.  Attempts will be made to keep disruption to the employee to a minimum.

With sustainability and conservation in mind, these positions will provide WDFW with the information needed to estimate harvest and the impacts of sport fisheries to ESA Listed species and other species.

These are opportunities to conduct sport fishery monitoring in the Tri-cities area during the fall salmon fishery and assists with stream surveys in the Hanford Reach/Yakima River.

We are seeking candidates to be responsible for estimating effort, catch, harvest, and origin of salmon and steelhead during summer and fall fisheries from the Highway 395 Bridge (Pasco) upstream to Priest Rapids Dam.
 

WHAT TO EXPECT
Among the varied range of responsibilities held within this role, this position will:

Field Data Collection.
Sport Fishery Surveys: Collect detailed information from anglers participating in salmon/steelhead sport fisheries during on-site interviews at area boat launches and shoreline fishing access areas. Determine effort through boat trailer index counts and interviews.

Stream Surveys: Collect post spawn salmon carcasses in-river by boat and along shorelines within the WDFW District 4 waters of the Columbia and Yakima Rivers. Sampling protocols will follow sport fishery methods with the addition of otolith collection (aging and origin) and spawn success (egg retention). Females will be dissected to determine spawn success. All carcasses will be cut in half post sampling to avoid duplicate sampling.
Ensure all biological samples are collected following field sampling protocols defined by their supervisor(s). All salmon will be scanned for the presence of coded wire tags. Any fish with a coded wire tag present will be sampled following standard protocols and the snout will be removed and transported to the WDFW District office for processing.

Many locations are primitive without facilities or quick availability to medical facilities.  Majority of the work will be near the Hanford Department of Energy site.  This position may involve working in or near water, including tasks that require navigating, negotiating, and performing duties related to water environments.

Schedule: Position is fulltime and may occasionally require work over 40 hours per week. Scheduled days and hours of work will vary and will require work on weekends and potentially on holidays.

Travel requirements: Routinely travel to public and primitive access sites along the Columbia and lower Yakima Rivers. State vehicle will be provided. Stream surveys will require travel and routinely working from boats in the Columbia River.

Customer Interactions: daily interactions with anglers and the public during creel surveys. Technician will be collecting angler information on fishing times, locations, catch, and harvest in addition to biologically sampling all fish from each boat/angler.

Purpose — About Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC):   
Empowering youth and adults to cultivate compassion, responsibility and life skills through community service, hard work and land stewardship.    
 SECC, a program of Conservation Legacy, is a non-profit AmeriCorps program. We engage youth (age 15-17) and young adults (ages 18-30, up to 35 for veterans) in service projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. Our AmeriCorps positions provide impactful educational and service opportunities that benefit both communities and landscapes. SECC’s participants reflect the population of the Southeast region, including youth, graduates, veterans, and individuals from various ethnic and economic backgrounds.  
 SECC collaborates with land management agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, local municipalities, and non-profits to host day and camping crews. Our projects vary but include trail construction and maintenance, restoration of natural areas, invasive species removal, fire fuels reduction, fencing, herbicide applications, and more. Most projects involve strenuous manual labor and require hiking to and from the project sites daily, carrying tools and day packs.   
    SECC camping crews serve in frontcountry and backcountry locations, often in challenging weather conditions. While hitch schedules vary by project and location, they typically follow a 9-day on, 5-day off pattern, with 10-hour shifts and scheduled breaks throughout the day. While we aim to maintain consistency, flexibility is expected as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change based on project needs.      
    SECC is an independent, non-residential program, and crew members are responsible for securing their own housing when not in the field. On-hitch, crews manage camp chores and prepare all their own meals, with evenings often including group discussions. Members must provide their own personal outdoor gear (e.g., tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, multi-day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots), while SECC provides group camp equipment, tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC Office and project sites.   
    Description of Duties — Position Summary 

Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC) Strike Team has partnered with a range of land managers across the Southeast, including the U.S. Forest Service at Bankhead National Forest, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in South Carolina, and Tennessee State Parks. This multi-agency initiative is rooted in a shared commitment to restoring land integrity, enhancing visitor experiences, and preparing young adults for careers in conservation. 


Crews should anticipate some hitches in rugged backcountry conditions and will be camping in remote, primitive settings to complete essential conservation projects.  


 


Service Project: 

Members of the Strike Team should expect a wide array of land management projects. During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors in all weather conditions, performing heavy manual labor related to environmental conservation and restoration projects.  Most projects require hiking out to project sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack. Projects can include the following, but are not limited to: 

Brush and log out trail corridors.  
Mitigate drainage issues through water diversion methods, stepping stones, and natural surface improvements.  
Repair creek crossings and eroded segments to enhance trail navigability and reduce sedimentation.  
Decommission and obscure unauthorized user-created trails.  
Timber step installation  
Trail tread repair and widening  
Stone stair improvements or installation  
Community Service
 

Crew Life:    
SECC crews consist of 4-6 crew members and 2 crew leaders who provide project expertise, mentorship, training, and support to ensure the success of all participants. Food is provided while in the field, and crew members collaborate to plan meals and share chores, such as cooking and washing dishes. Most dietary restrictions can be accommodated if communicated in advance. Crew members must be prepared to camp, travel, complete service projects, and share meals as a team. No drug or alcohol consumption is allowed during service-related activities or travel at any time.   
 Crew members will need to supply their own personal equipment such as a day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots, etc. SECC will provide tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC office and project sites. SECC has a limited supply of loaner gear available for crew members to borrow. While this gear can be helpful, we strongly recommend that members bring as much of their own gear as possible, as the loaner equipment may not fully meet personal preferences or specific needs. 
 SECC supports a culture of feedback and growth. Crew Members will set goals at the beginning of the season and review their performance through both self-evaluation and a review with their Crew Leader in the middle and at the end of their season. Evaluations will cover areas such as professionalism, responsibility and leadership, communication, engagement, productivity, safety, and equipment use. Crew Members will also be asked to evaluate their Crew Leaders’ performance, the overall program, and their experience at the end of their term.

  Purpose — About Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC):
Empowering youth and adults to cultivate compassion, responsibility and life skills through community service, hard work and land stewardship.  
 SECC, a program of Conservation Legacy, is a non-profit AmeriCorps program. We engage youth (age 15-17) and young adults (ages 18-30, up to 35 for veterans) in service projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. Our AmeriCorps positions provide impactful educational and service opportunities that benefit both communities and landscapes. SECC’s participants reflect the population of the Southeast region, including youth, graduates, veterans, and individuals from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. 
SECC collaborates with land management agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, local municipalities, and non-profits to host day and camping crews. Our projects vary but include trail construction and maintenance, restoration of natural areas, invasive species removal, fire fuels reduction, fencing, herbicide applications, and more. Most projects involve strenuous manual labor and require hiking to and from the project sites daily, carrying tools and day packs.   
  SECC camping crews serve in frontcountry and backcountry locations, often in challenging weather conditions. While hitch schedules vary by project and location, they typically follow a 9-day on, 5-day off pattern, with 10-hour shifts and scheduled breaks throughout the day. While we aim to maintain consistency, flexibility is expected as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change based on project needs.  
  SECC is an independent, non-residential program, and crew members are responsible for securing their own housing when not in the field. On-hitch, crews manage camp chores and prepare all their own meals, with evenings often including group discussions. Members must provide their own personal outdoor gear (e.g., tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, multi-day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots), while SECC provides group camp equipment, tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC Office and project sites. 
    Description of Duties — Position Summary 
 Service Project:  
Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC) and Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area (LBL) have partnered to host a Recreation and Fire Prevention Crew. The crew will be based out of SECCs Chattanooga, TN office and travel to LBL to primarily support recreation and fire management operations. 
The crew will be managed by LBL Forest Service staff and collaboratively aid in these pre-identified restoration projects. During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors in all weather conditions, performing heavy manual labor related to environmental conservation and restoration projects. Most projects require hiking out to project sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack.  
The projects will vary based on priorities and environmental factors but will focus on: 
Hazard tree removal and sawyer work, including felling, bucking, limbing, swamping, etc.  
Traditional trail building/maintenance, including logging out, brushing, reblazing, tread repair, water-bar installation, etc.   
Recreation site improvements including trailhead and signage maintenance/replacement.  
Restoration/stabilization of shelters and other structures 
Establishment of prescribed fire containment line, completed with traditional wildland firefighting tools, such as: leaf blower, fire rake, rogue hoe, Mcleod, Pulaski, etc.

 Crew Life:  
SECC crews consist of 4-6 crew members and 2 crew leaders who provide project expertise, mentorship, training, and support to ensure the success of all participants.

 Crew members will need to supply their own personal equipment such as a day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots, etc. SECC will provide tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC office and project sites. SECC has a limited supply of loaner gear available for crew members to borrow. While this gear can be helpful, we strongly recommend that members bring as much of their own gear as possible, as the loaner equipment may not fully meet personal preferences or specific needs. 
 SECC supports a culture of feedback and growth. Crew Members will set goals at the beginning of the season and review their performance through both self-evaluation and a review with their Crew Leader in the middle and at the end of their season. Evaluations will cover areas such as professionalism, responsibility and leadership, communication, engagement, productivity, safety, and equipment use. Crew Members will also be asked to evaluate their Crew Leaders’ performance, the overall program, and their experience at the end of their term.  
   Hitch Schedule:  
This position will operate on a variable “hitch” schedule, but generally it will follow 9 days on and 5 days off for camping crews. Project days follow a 10-hour shift with scheduled time for breaks. While the staff at SECC strive to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs. Applicants should be prepared to camp during hitches for the duration of the season, with lodging provided on a case-by-case basis if necessary.  
  Requirements:  
 Minimum Qualifications:  
Must be between ages 18 and 30, and up to 35 if a military veteran.  
Must be a US Citizen or Permanent Resident and provide primary documentation to support this  
Must be cleared through an acceptable check of the National Sex Offender Public Registry, as well as state and federal Criminal History Checks

   Purpose — About Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC):
Empowering youth and adults to cultivate compassion, responsibility and life skills through community service, hard work and land stewardship.  
 SECC, a program of Conservation Legacy, is a non-profit AmeriCorps program. We engage youth (age 15-17) and young adults (ages 18-30, up to 35 for veterans) in service projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. Our AmeriCorps positions provide impactful educational and service opportunities that benefit both communities and landscapes. SECC’s participants reflect the population of the Southeast region, including youth, graduates, veterans, and individuals from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. 
SECC collaborates with land management agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, local municipalities, and non-profits to host day and camping crews. Our projects vary but include trail construction and maintenance, restoration of natural areas, invasive species removal, fire fuels reduction, fencing, herbicide applications, and more. Most projects involve strenuous manual labor and require hiking to and from the project sites daily, carrying tools and day packs.   
  SECC camping crews serve in frontcountry and backcountry locations, often in challenging weather conditions. While hitch schedules vary by project and location, they typically follow a 9-day on, 5-day off pattern, with 10-hour shifts and scheduled breaks throughout the day. While we aim to maintain consistency, flexibility is expected as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change based on project needs.  
  SECC is an independent, non-residential program, and crew members are responsible for securing their own housing when not in the field. On-hitch, crews manage camp chores and prepare all their own meals, with evenings often including group discussions. Members must provide their own personal outdoor gear (e.g., tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, multi-day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots), while SECC provides group camp equipment, tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC Office and project sites. 
    Description of Duties — Position Summary 
  Position Summary: 

Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC) has partnered with Natchez Trace Parkway to host a fall conservation crew along the Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail. This project is rooted in a commitment to restoring land integrity, enhancing visitor experiences, and preparing young adults for careers in conservation. 

 The conservation crew member position is an entry-level role. Crew members are supported on various levels by their crew leaders, program staff, project partners, and Conservation Legacy staff. We ask that crew members embrace learning opportunities, face challenges, and build community with their crew.  
  Service Project:  
The crew will be based out of SECCs Chattanooga, TN office and travel to The Natchez Trace Parkway to primarily focus on rehabilitation projects along the Ridgeland section of the parkway in and around Jackson, MS. The crew will be managed by the Trail Program Coordinator and collaboratively aid in these pre-identified restoration projects. During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors in all weather conditions, performing heavy manual labor related to conservation and restoration projects. Most projects require hiking out to project sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack. Projects can include the following, but are not limited to: 
Repair and construct trail bridges and boardwalks  
Trail construction and maintenance  
ex. Water bars, drain dips, reroutes of sections of trail, fixing slope 
Corridor clearing 
Invasive species removal 
Replace equestrian hitching posts 
Repair or install water structures along trails 
Community Service  
  Crew Life:  
SECC crews consist of 4-6 crew members and 2 crew leaders who provide project expertise, mentorship, training, and support to ensure the success of all participants. Food is provided while in the field, and crew members collaborate to plan meals and share chores, such as cooking and washing dishes. Most dietary restrictions can be accommodated if communicated in advance. Crew members must be prepared to camp, travel, complete service projects, and share meals as a team. No drug or alcohol consumption is allowed during service-related activities or travel at any time.  
 Crew members will need to supply their own personal equipment such as a day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots, etc. SECC will provide tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC office and project sites. SECC has a limited supply of loaner gear available for crew members to borrow. While this gear can be helpful, we strongly recommend that members bring as much of their own gear as possible, as the loaner equipment may not fully meet personal preferences or specific needs. 
 SECC supports a culture of feedback and growth. Crew Members will set goals at the beginning of the season and review their performance through both self-evaluation and a review with their Crew Leader in the middle and at the end of their season. Evaluations will cover areas such as professionalism, responsibility and leadership, communication, engagement, productivity, safety, and equipment use. Crew Members will also be asked to evaluate their Crew Leaders’ performance, the overall program, and their experience at the end of their term.  
   Hitch Schedule:  
This position will operate on a variable “hitch” schedule, but generally it will follow 9 days on and 5 days off for camping crews. Project days follow a 10-hour shift with scheduled time for breaks. While the staff at SECC strive to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs. Applicants should be prepared to camp during hitches for the duration of the season, with lodging provided on a case-by-case basis if necessary.  
  Requirements:  
 Minimum Qualifications:  
Must be between ages 18 and 30, and up to 35 if a military veteran.  
Must be a US Citizen or Permanent Resident and provide primary documentation to support this  
Must be cleared through an acceptable check of the National Sex Offender Public Registry, as well as state and federal Criminal History Checks  
Must have a high school diploma, GED, or agree to work toward attaining either during term of service (this is essential to obtaining and using the AmeriCorps Education Award)

If you need assistance and/or a reasonable accommodation due to a disability during application or recruiting process, please send a request to the hiring manager. 
  Participant Essential Eligibility Requirements  
Essential eligibility requirements for the program must be met. If you are unable to meet certain requirements, we may be able to assist you with some modification unless it alters the fundamental nature of the program, compromises the health and safety of participants or staff, or places an undue financial or administrative burden on the organization. These requirements are written the same for all positions and therefore may not apply directly to your particular position.  
 Time Requirements: 
Typically, this position is expected to serve August to November, but exact service schedules may vary. A half hour lunch break will not be counted towards AmeriCorps service  
Members may be required to participate in national, state, or local service projects or events as part of their service term. 
 Orientation and Training: 
Members will receive an orientation that includes training on AmeriCorps prohibited and unallowable activities. 
 **SECC is a nonresidential program. Housing is not provided during off-hitch (Wednesday-Monday) evenings. Crew members are responsible for securing their own housing arrangements while not in the field. 
 Evaluation and Reporting: 
As an AmeriCorps member, performance will be evaluated on whether the member has completed the required number of hours, the member has satisfactorily completed assignments, and if the member has met other performance criteria that were clearly communicated at the beginning of the term of service. 
 Reporting requirements include, but are not limited to, bi-weekly timesheets and accomplishment tracking.

ROLE OVERVIEW | SummitWest is seeking a skilled and experienced Cultural Resources Lead to oversee and support archaeological projects across California. This role involves leading fieldwork and office-based tasks, including archaeological surveys, monitoring, excavations, data collection, construction oversight, and technical report preparation. The ideal candidate is an effective leader and problem solver, capable of managing project teams, ensuring regulatory compliance, and maintaining high-quality deliverables. This position offers the opportunity to mentor junior staff, collaborate with interdisciplinary teams, and contribute to the preservation of cultural resources while working on dynamic projects across diverse landscapes.

Are you ready to take the next step in your archaeology career? Apply now to join SummitWest and lead impactful cultural resource management efforts!

ROLE DESCRIPTION & DUTIES | The ideal candidate is a detail-oriented Lead Archaeologist ready with experience in both field and office tasks, including surveys, monitoring, excavations, data collection, and report preparation. The position offers opportunities for professional growth, travel, and meaningful contributions to cultural resource preservation. Key responsibilities include but are not limited to:

KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
Field Leadership: Lead and supervise pedestrian surveys, archaeological testing, and excavation efforts, ensuring compliance with project requirements and regulatory standards.
Construction Monitoring: Oversee and conduct archaeological monitoring during construction, coordinating with contractors, and ensuring mitigation measures are followed.
Data Collection & Management: Record archaeological sites, analyze artifacts, and utilize mapping and data collection tools such as GPS, tablets, and ESRI-based applications.
Technical Writing & Documentation: Prepare detailed reports, site records, and compliance documentation, ensuring data accuracy and adherence to regulations.
Project Management Support: Assist senior staff in developing project scopes, managing deadlines, and ensuring deliverables meet client and regulatory expectations.
Compliance & Advisory: Work closely with project managers, engineers, and regulatory agencies to ensure adherence to local, state, and federal cultural resource laws.
Mentorship & Team Coordination: Provide training and leadership to field crews, ensuring efficiency, data accuracy, and safety in all field operations.
Collaboration & Communication: Maintain clear communication with clients, construction personnel, regulatory agencies, and internal teams.

ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES:

ROLE OVERVIEW | SummitWest is seeking an experienced Senior Cultural Resources Lead with 10+ years of cultural resources management experience, including project management and leadership in California. The ideal candidate will have extensive field expertise conducting surveys, testing, excavation, monitoring, and laboratory analysis, as well as experience as a Project Manager or Principal Investigator on complex projects.

In this role, the Senior Cultural Resources Lead will contribute to the growth of SummitWest’s Cultural Resources Program, driving profitability and aligning high-quality systems and teams with client objectives. This is an exciting opportunity to work with a dynamic and dedicated team in a company that values professionalism, collaboration, and innovation. If you are passionate about cultural resource management and looking to make an impact, we encourage you to apply and join our growing team!

ROLE DESCRIPTION & DUTIES | This role requires a blend of field experience, technical writing, regulatory knowledge, leadership, and project management skills to navigate and ensure the completion of archaeological projects. Key responsibilities include but are not limited to:

KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
Field Leadership: Lead and supervise pedestrian surveys, archaeological testing, and excavation while ensuring compliance with project requirements and regulatory standards.
Construction Monitoring: Plan, oversee and conduct archaeological monitoring during construction activities, collaborating with contractors and ensuring mitigation measures are implemented correctly.
Data Collection & Management: Record archaeological sites, analyze artifacts, and utilize mapping and data collection tools such as GPS, tablets, and ESRI-based applications.
Technical Writing & Documentation: Prepare detailed reports, site records, and compliance documentation, ensuring data accuracy and adherence to regulations.
Project Management Support: Assist senior staff in developing project scopes, managing deadlines, and ensuring deliverables meet client and regulatory expectations.
Compliance & Advisory: Work closely with project managers, engineers, and regulatory agencies to ensure adherence to local, state, and federal cultural resource laws.
Mentorship & Team Coordination: Provide training and leadership to staff ensuring efficiency, data accuracy, and safety in all field operations.
Collaboration & Communication: Maintain clear communication with clients, construction personnel, regulatory agencies, tribes, stakeholders and internal teams to ensure smooth operations and project success.
Regulatory Knowledge: Keeping a strong working knowledge of relevant regulations and overseeing consultation processes with Native American groups and stakeholders for sensitive resource issues.
Project Management: Independently managing projects, overseeing scopes, budgets, timelines, and contract compliance.
Quality Assurance & Control (QA/QC): Performing quality checks on field data and technical reports to ensure all project aspects are properly executed.

Author technical reports, including CEQA/NEPA sections, mitigation plans, and monitoring reports.
Represent SummitWest at professional conferences and industry meetings.

PLEASE NOTE: This is an environmental consulting job, not a conservation job. Unlike conservation roles, which strive to protect the environment at all costs, this position focuses on helping construction contractors remain in compliance with environmental laws and mitigation measures, ensuring the client avoids issues by advising contractors on where, when, and how work can take place to prevent delays in construction. These determinations are often made prior to deployment into the field, or sometimes in conjunction with the contractors on site. It is vital to ensure that they are not working without our knowledge and requires clear and concise communication with multiple team members, crews, and departments.

Experience leading pedestrian surveys, excavation, and site mitigation projects, collaborating with staff, construction personnel, managing survey, testing, and data recovery projects in environmental or cultural consulting.
