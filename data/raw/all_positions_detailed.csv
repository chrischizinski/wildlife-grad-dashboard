PhD Scholarship
Transforming Climate Action – Uncertain Seas 
 
A PhD Scholarship is available at the Centre for Fisheries Ecosystems Research, Fisheries & Marine Institute, Memorial University, St. John’s, NL, Canada.

Transforming Climate Action is a seven year, $397 million collaboration among Dalhousie University, Laval University, University Québec at Rimouski, and Memorial University. The largest research theme within Transforming Climate Action is Reducing Uncertainties in Carbon Cycling in the Northwest Atlantic Seas (Uncertain Seas). The goal of Uncertain Seas is to better constrain the role of the ocean in the Earth’s climate system by reducing uncertainties with physical and biogeochemical processes that control the global ocean carbon cycle. The focus is on the Northwest Atlantic gateway as a major contributor to ocean carbon uptake and sequestration, particularly with respect to the biological carbon pump.
We are seeking a PhD Student to estimate carbon fluxes in the Northwest Atlantic from Earth system and ecosystem models. As a part of Transforming Climate Action, there will be opportunities to participate in workshops with other graduate students from the four institutions. There will also be opportunities for research visits to collaborating labs and conference travel. There may be opportunities to participate in research expeditions, although not a requirement.  

Location: The student will be enrolled in the PhD in Fisheries Science graduate program at the Fisheries & Marine Institute, Memorial University, in St. John’s, NL, Canada.  Memorial University is a hub of ocean sciences located in the Province’s capital. St. John’s is a safe and friendly city with great historical charm, known for its hospitality, live music, a vibrant cultural life, and easy access to wilderness and a wide range of outdoor activities.

Requirements: 
 MSc or equivalent in Fisheries Science, Ecology, Statistics, Mathematics, Marine Ecology, Biology, Oceanography or related discipline 
 Demonstrated quantitative skills in ecosystem and/or statistical modelling
 Strong writing and communication skills

Start date: Flexible, ideally September 1, 2026

Stipend: $30K/year for four years

Description
The Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Design at West Virginia University, through Dr. Carol Arantes’s lab, is recruiting a Master’s or PhD student to begin in Fall 2026 to study how changes in river conditions affect aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity. 

The student will be part of a collaborative, interdisciplinary project examining how global hydraulic infrastructure and river management over the past century have altered river discharge regimes and aquatic ecosystems, and how uncertainty in reconstructed historical records affects confidence in global assessments of river change. Working within a multi-institutional research team, the student will collaborate closely with a modeling group to develop and apply new models and indicators of river processes that integrate hydrologic alteration, river fragmentation, sediment transport, river temperature, and patterns of fish diversity and abundance. 

The student will work closely with the PI, postdoctoral researchers, and a multi-institutional team of project partners to integrate ecological data with large-scale environmental and infrastructure datasets. Expected outcomes include peer-reviewed publications, technical reports, and presentations for both scientific and non-scientific audiences. The position offers strong training opportunities in quantitative analysis, interdisciplinary research, and professional development. 

Qualifications 
Applicants must hold a B.S. or M.S. degree in ecology, fisheries, zoology, aquatic sciences, or a closely related field, with a minimum GPA of 3.0/4.0. Successful candidates will demonstrate strong written and oral communication skills, solid analytical abilities, and the capacity to work independently and collaboratively. Experience or strong interest in fish and aquatic ecology is required. Experience with or interest in computer modeling, statistical analysis (Bayesian and/or frequentist approaches), and GIS is highly desirable. 

 Funding:
The selected student will be supported through a combination of Teaching Assistantships (TAships) and Research Assistantships (RAships), for a total of three years of funding.

M.S. students will receive a stipend of $21,000 per year plus a full tuition waiver.

Description
This is a 9-month tenure-accruing position that will be 70% research (Florida Agricultural Experiment Station) and 30% extension (Florida Cooperative Extension Service), available at the Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center, Davie, FL, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, at the University of Florida.  Tenure will accrue in the Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation. This assignment may change in accordance with the needs of the unit. 
 Duties will include development of a productive, interdisciplinary, extramurally funded research program in the field of invasive wildlife ecology with a focus on providing natural resource managers, private landowners, and other stakeholders with scientific information to contribute to development of effective data-driven control strategies for invasive wildlife that threaten ecosystem health and economic sustainability. In addition, this program will provide baseline data to determine impacts of invasive wildlife species on native fauna and ecosystems, agricultural production, and the built environment's infrastructure. This may include, but is not limited to, application of field-based approaches, statistical modeling, artificial intelligence/machine learning, and molecular techniques aimed to identify impacts and to improve detection, removal, and monitoring of invasive wildlife. As an interdisciplinary field, invasion ecology affords many opportunities for internal and external collaborations, and the candidate is encouraged to seek collaborations with established research programs at UF/IFAS, other academic institutions, and government agencies. 
 Extension responsibilities may include developing educational programs and toolkits on detecting, reporting, and controlling invasive wildlife species. The incumbent will provide proactive leadership, training, and assistance to UF and other stakeholders. Interaction with local, state, and federal agencies as well as Indian tribes will be important to this position. The faculty member will actively participate in graduate education by chairing graduate committees, serving on graduate committees, supervising thesis and dissertation research, and publishing the results with their graduate students. Faculty are encouraged to participate in professional development activities related to teaching and advising and may teach courses and seminars. The faculty member will actively seek extramural funding to support their program, publish in referred journals, and produce extension publications. The faculty member is expected to engage in extension activities in their program area.
 Because of the IFAS land-grant mission, all faculty are expected to be supportive of and engaged in all three mission areas—Research, Teaching and Extension—regardless of the assignment split specified in the position description.

Description
The Hopcroft lab within the College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (CFOS) is looking for a motivated individual with interests in the study of zooplankton within high latitude ecosystems. The lab spans the full spectrum of zooplankton groups from crustaceans to gelatinous taxa, from morphological to molecular identifications, and from net-based sampling to in situ imaging. The position will involve several weeks per year in the field (typically on larger research vessels), operation and maintenance of field-going electronic equipment, plus processing of samples in the laboratory and conducting preliminary analysis of the data generated. The opportunity also exists for varying degrees of involvement in scientific publication. Prior experience working with zooplankton is required, as is computer proficiency. Prior experience is desirable but not required for molecular laboratory work or imaging systems, as essential training on either can be provided.

The College has over 150 faculty, researchers and staff based throughout Alaska. 

This is anticipated to be a long-term hire as part of larger team of zooplankton professionals and graduate students. This position is located on the Troth Yeddha' campus in Fairbanks Alaska. The position has some flexibility in work schedule and the number of hours worked per week, such that the successful candidate may elect to work less than full time if desired (i.e., from 20-40 hours per week).

This is a term-funded, exempt staff position complete with both a competitive salary and full employee benefits package. UA provides a generous compensation package that includes retirement options, annual leave, 12 paid holidays per year, tuition waivers for employees and family members, and affordable medical, dental and vision care coverage.

Actions taken are similar and well established.

At the upper end of the range, the Accounting Technician uses different and unrelated processes, procedures, or methods. The employee decides what needs to be done by identifying the nature of the problem, question, or issue. He/she then determines and obtains needed information by all appropriate means. The employee may have to consider previous actions and understand how these actions differ from or are similar to the issue at hand.

Scope and Effect:

The PSMFC Fiscal Officer depends on the information in the accounting system for up-to-date reports and revenue needs forecasting for cash flow activity maintenance. Accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of accounts are essential because of the many federal, state, and private contract funding sources, and for preparing billings to agencies for work performed.

Personal Contacts:

Contacts within PSMFC include working with staff members and field employees in 6 states. Contacts outside PSMFC include working with vendors and various state and federal agency accounting department personnel and program managers.

Purpose of Contacts:

Contacts are to plan and coordinate actions to correct or prevent errors, delays, or other complications during the transaction cycle. This may involve obtaining cooperation to submit paperwork or other information, or requesting other staff to correct errors in documentation, or assisting others in locating information.

Physical Demands:

The work is sedentary. Employee may need to carry light items such as files or pamphlets but position does not require any special physical effort.

Location: Toucan Ridge Ecology and Education Society

Duration: Sessions may be 2 to 5 weeks, with 4 weeks recommended 
Hours per Week: 35 – 40 
Cost: $289USD/Week  
  Description: 
 The T.R.E.E.S Farm has been established as a Farm-to-Table organic operation and regenerative agriculture demonstration farm. Its primary purpose is to serve the original needs of the NGO’s operations which are wildlife conservation through research and education. This is accomplished through the layout of the farm which provides extensive wildlife habitat and foraging opportunities, increasing the local faunal biodiversity as well as acting as an educational demonstration to local subsistence farmers and visiting students.  
  Interns will learn by assisting in implementation and evaluation of management practices, cropping, and record keeping on the farm with this vision in mind while we endeavor to maximize the products coming from the farm with the existing design and layout using sustainable and regenerative practices specific to the Mesoamerican uplands. Within this broad framework, intern projects can include several basic Agricultural Education disciplines including Tropical Agriculture, Sustainable/organic Agriculture, Farm Management, Waste management, and Agricultural Economics.  
  In addition to planting crops, we also have free range chickens and ducks for eggs and meat. We are looking to increase our revenue generation from the farm either in the form of increased accountable products entering our kitchen for use in our restaurant, or for sale to the Mobile Market or in a proposed road-side café which would be managed by T.R.E.E.S kitchen and hospitality staff. Thus, interns would also assist us with our marketing strategy for existing products and/or planting. 
  By the successful conclusion of this internship, the student will be able to apply practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species, basic free range poultry operations, evaluate different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns, and become familiar with sustainable management practices such as no/low till, cover cropping, waste management, mulching, marketing, Farm-to-Table, etc. 
    Requirements: 
 No prior tropical agriculture experience required. Interns can be current undergraduate or graduate students enrolled in a program with their University/College for credit, however non-students can also apply; but preference will be given to students enrolled in an accreditation program. Experienced tropical agriculturalists and/or agroforestry professionals are also welcome and will be treated according to their experience level and are eligible for *discounted rates. 
    Internship Responsibilities: 
 Applying practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species and basic free range poultry operations. 
Evaluating different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns. 
Work on Inga Alley-cropping and other regenerative cropping practices, and using intercropping, organic fertilizing and pest control practices. 
Assist with innovative marketing strategies for existing products accompanied by reviewing projected budgets for the farm and their products and exploring cost/profit ratios for poultry husbandry. 
Planting and selling new products for the farm. 
Opportunities are also available to observe and participate with concurrent intern and wildlife educational activities such as mist-netting, observing and recording measurements of bats, birds, herps, invertebrates, water quality, and much more. 
Interns will assist with creating captions for social media posts to engage and update followers on what has been going on at the field station and various projects that are being done. 
     Costs: 
 The internship fee includes room and board (meals included Monday-Friday), full access to lab equipment, and training by professional on-site biologists. Food is a combination of self-catering in a communal kitchen with ingredients provided as well as prepared meals, depending on whether we have other groups on site. Lodging at the research center signifies a shared dormitory-style rustic cabins with other same sex interns. This comes with full access to other facilities such as showers, restrooms, and kitchen. The nature of this program allows interns to carry out most of the work independently after the training period is done. Fees do not include airport transfer, flights, travel medical insurance, or $100 USD visitor permit fee if remaining in country for more than 30 days.    
  We are hoping to expand our internship program beyond North America. Citizens from Latin America and the Caribbean will be charged at a discounted rate of 50%. Belizeans will get another discount. For more information, kindly email Scandia Cruz with the email provided above. 
    Schedule: 
 Interns are required to work for 35 hours/week minimum. The typical schedule runs from Monday through Friday, from 6:30 am until 12:30 pm and 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm. Weekends are free time for interns; therefore, you can do as please (travel, hike, relax). No refunds on food and lodging will be available if the intern decides to leave the station. Projects may sometimes run into the weekend; in which case the days will be returned to them during the week. The intern supervisor(s) will be responsible for designing a schedule with the intern each week that is reasonable and includes work on the various projects.

Emergency Response – APHIS is an emergency response agency. This means that all Agency employees may be asked or assigned to participate in rotating temporary duty assignments to support emergency programs at some time during their careers with APHIS. It is difficult to predict the frequency with which such emergency situations may occur – and could range from several emergencies in a year to none over the course of many years. In the event that you are called upon to support an emergency program, this may require irregular working hours, including overtime, and may include duties other than those specified in your official position description. While some emergency program support assignments may be able to be performed at the employee’s current duty station, in other cases employees may be asked to go on-site to a temporary duty state location. In addition, it may be necessary for employees to participate in multiple rotations to an emergency program assignment. Attempts will be made to keep disruption to the employee to a minimum.

Emergency Response – APHIS is an emergency response agency. This means that all Agency employees may be asked or assigned to participate in rotating temporary duty assignments to support emergency programs at some time during their careers with APHIS. It is difficult to predict the frequency with which such emergency situations may occur – and could range from several emergencies in a year to none over the course of many years. In the event that you are called upon to support an emergency program, this may require irregular working hours, including overtime, and may include duties other than those specified in your official position description. While some emergency program support assignments may be able to be performed at the employee’s current duty station, in other cases employees may be asked to go on-site to a temporary duty state location. In addition, it may be necessary for employees to participate in multiple rotations to an emergency program assignment. Attempts will be made to keep disruption to the employee to a minimum.
