Description
RIO GRANDE CUTTHROAT TROUT PHD ASSISTANTSHIP

Description & project background: 

The Pregler Lab at New Mexico State University in the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Ecology invites applications for a PhD research assistantship focused on Rio Grande cutthroat trout conservation. The successful applicant will begin in the Fall 2026 semester.

Rio Grande cutthroat trout (RGCT) are the southernmost species of cutthroat trout and have experienced a severe decline in both range and abundance, now occupying only ~12 percent of its historical distribution and requires targeted management interventions to support recovery. Major components of the recovery plan detail the need to secure extant populations and reintroduce individuals within their native range in Colorado and New Mexico. Recent efforts to date include development of a multi-source, genetically diverse broodstock for the Rio Grande basin that is used for reintroduction efforts.

Individuals from this multi-source broodstock were stocked at multiple sites throughout the recently restored Rio Costilla watershed which represents one of the largest native fish restoration projects in the country. While recent research has shown that this composite broodstock is more genetically diverse compared to using single source populations there is a need to evaluate how these fish are performing in the wild. The present project has a number of goals:

          1. Evaluate genetic structure and diversity of reintroduced Rio Costilla RGCT populations
                     a. There is also opportunity to develop questions with demographic monitoring data in this system.
          2. Genetic assessment of Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos basins. 
                     a. Results will help inform multi-source broodstock development for Canadian & Pecos basins and identify additional source populations for Rio Grande basin.
                     b. Results will also provide an updated genetic assessment for RGCT.
          3. There are additional opportunities for the student to develop their own questions using genetic and demographic data.

This project is a collaborative effort funded by the New Mexico Department of Wildlife and there may be potential to collaborate with other university researchers and agencies. Benefits include a salary range of ~$28-29k/year, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance. Funding will also be available for conference travel, workshop training for data analyses, and safety training (e.g., wilderness first aid). The hired candidate will begin in Fall 2026 and will be based at NMSU in Las Cruces, NM.

How to apply: If interested, please compile the following: (1) a statement of interest that describes your educational and research background, as well as your research interests and how this position fits in your career goals (2) curriculum vitae or resume, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts compiled in a single PDF and save as ‘Lastname_RGCT_PhD.pdf’.  Applicants are also asked to upload a writing sample in the application portal. Applications should be submitted through the airtable linked here:  https://airtable.com/app3jNqbQZsYstwx7/pagrpU5GqaI6FnSTg/form 

Applications are due 03/18/26 by 11:59p MT. You can learn more about the Pregler Lab at https://preglerlab.com and any questions about the position can be sent to Dr. Kasey Pregler at kpregler@nmsu.edu.   

Qualifications: 

Required: B.S. in fisheries, biology, or related field and possession of a valid U.S. driver’s license. The successful applicant must also meet the minimum requirements for admission to the NMSU Graduate School (3.0 GPA in last two years of undergrad). Applicants should also have demonstrated excellent written and oral communication skills, and an ability to work independently. 

Preference will be given to applicants with an M.S. degree in fisheries, biology, or related field and have experience working in the backcountry and are willing to lead field work crews in backcountry conditions.

Successful candidates will have proficiency in R, and an interest in genetics and working with large datasets. They should also demonstrate the ability to work as part of a team and have a willingness to lead field work crews in remote backcountry locations. Applicants with experience in fish ecology, statistical & genetic analysis, and hierarchical modeling are encouraged to apply.

While recent research has shown that this composite broodstock is more genetically diverse compared to using single source populations there is a need to evaluate how these fish are performing in the wild. The present project has a number of goals:

          1. Evaluate genetic structure and diversity of reintroduced Rio Costilla RGCT populations
                     a. There is also opportunity to develop questions with demographic monitoring data in this system.
          2. Genetic assessment of Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos basins. 
                     a. Results will help inform multi-source broodstock development for Canadian & Pecos basins and identify additional source populations for Rio Grande basin.
                     b. Results will also provide an updated genetic assessment for RGCT.
          3. There are additional opportunities for the student to develop their own questions using genetic and demographic data.

This project is a collaborative effort funded by the New Mexico Department of Wildlife and there may be potential to collaborate with other university researchers and agencies. Benefits include a salary range of ~$28-29k/year, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance. Funding will also be available for conference travel, workshop training for data analyses, and safety training (e.g., wilderness first aid). The hired candidate will begin in Fall 2026 and will be based at NMSU in Las Cruces, NM.

How to apply: If interested, please compile the following: (1) a statement of interest that describes your educational and research background, as well as your research interests and how this position fits in your career goals (2) curriculum vitae or resume, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts compiled in a single PDF and save as ‘Lastname_RGCT_PhD.pdf’.

 M.S. Assistantship – Raven Movement Ecology in Prairie Canada
Dr. Adam Janke & Dr. Gunnar Kramer – Iowa State University
Dr. Jay VonBank, Dr. Todd Arnold, Dr. Frank Rohwer & Jacob Bushaw – Delta Waterfowl Foundation
 PROJECT BACKGROUND
Delta Waterfowl, in collaboration with Iowa State University (ISU), is recruiting a highly motivated M.S. student to investigate the movement ecology of common ravens and their role in waterfowl nest depredation within the prairie/parkland ecosystems of Saskatchewan, Canada. Ravens represent a relatively new and increasingly abundant nest predator in this region, and their expanding distribution poses emerging challenges for waterfowl reproductive success.
 This research will focus on quantifying spatial and temporal movement patterns of ravens using advanced GPS telemetry. The student will investigate how raven movement strategies, habitat-use dynamics, and associated behaviors contribute to waterfowl nest depredation. Results from this work will directly inform predator management strategies to enhance conservation planning for waterfowl populations within the northern Prairie Pothole Region. The selected candidate will collaborate closely with scientists from Delta Waterfowl and Iowa State University. Field operations will begin in April 2026 in Saskatchewan, and the graduate assistantship will formally begin at Iowa State University, Ames, IA, in August 2026.
 The assistantship is supported by a combination of teaching and research assistantships that provides a $28,800 per year stipend, health insurance, and a 75% tuition waiver.

Description
A graduate assistantship for a master’s student is expected to be funded at Colorado State University (Fort Collins, CO) working with Dr. Brian D. Gerber (https://bgerber123.github.io/) at the Colorado Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and wildlife researchers at Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The graduate research assistantship will cover university tuition, fees, health coverage, and includes a pre-tax monthly pay of $3000/month. The position is expected to start Fall 2026 and be funded through December 2028.

Study Context: Sex and age class are important demographic parameters used in population modeling, in which the results help guide management decisions and annual harvest quotas of large mammals (e.g., elk, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, mule deer). This work will help develop new methodology and workflows that will aid Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s objective of producing robust empirical demographic data and population estimates for harvested wildlife. 

Focus: The focus of this study will be to collect data on the size distribution of elk sex and age classes (cow, calf, bull) to train and test a predictive approach using AI algorithms (developed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife) to classify animals from high-resolution aerial imagery. Field observations and size measurements (via 3D camera) will be collected to help test the accuracy of AI predictions. An additional avenue of exploration may be data collection and AI classification of sex/age class from camera trap images. The student will be expected to develop a project proposal outlining study objectives in coordination with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and a graduate committee at Colorado State University. The student will focus on technological and software workflows to meet study objectives, however, there will likely be field work opportunities as well (e.g., field observations, drone/aerial surveys). Given the trajectory of the wildlife field, the skills gained in this study will likely be desirable for future employers. 

 Preferred Qualifications: 

-          Ungulate field research experience in the intermountain west
-          Clear interest or experience developing data analysis workflows
-          Clear interest or experience advancing technological innovation (hardware/software) in wildlife science
-          Experience deploying camera traps and managing large data sets
-          Experience with AI algorithms, for example MegaDetector or SpeciesNet
 
Minimum Qualifications:
-          A Bachelor of Science degree in wildlife ecology, biology, natural resource management, or related field
-          A year or more of wildlife related professional research/work experience
-          Strong writing skills
-          Strong work ethic 
-          Desire to collaborate with state wildlife management agencies

To be considered, please send the following materials via email with “AI/Elk Application” as the subject line to Dr. Brian D.

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNWRS) located in Seattle, Washington. Opportunity may also be remote.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: The fellow will be a part of development of a widely-used online wildland fire smoke modeling system that relies on the BlueSky Modeling Framework. The BlueSky Playground provides users with interactive access to fire, fuels, emissions, plume rise, and smoke dispersion modeling capabilities. It enables users to enter basic fire information and explore modeled outcomes across a variety of scenarios, supporting applications including prescribed burn planning, wildfire operations, research, and public communication. The fellow will be a part of the ground-up rewrite of the BlueSky Playground with the goal of developing a scalable, modern, and performant system that meets the needs of an active and diverse user base. This system is used operationally today across federal, state, and academic contexts, and the redevelopment effort will directly support real-world decision making.

Develop skills in a collaborative environment with interdisciplinary stakeholders, such as scientists, software engineers, and operational users
Mentor: The mentors for this opportunity are Susan O'Neill (susan.oneill1@usda.gov) and Sim Larkin (sim.larkin@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: Spring/Summer 2026.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The expectation is full time but can be part time initially. 

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. 

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service.

Description
ROJECT TITLE: Pinyon Jay response to juniper management, Deschutes County, Oregon.

BACKGROUND: Pinyon Jays (PIJA, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) have experienced significant, range-wide declines over the past 50 years, and are currently under Status Review for ESA listing. Deschutes County, Oregon represents the northwestern-most extent of the species range and lies far outside the extant range of pinyon pine species. Extensive treatments of juniper woodlands have been expedited throughout western states for restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, sage grouse habitat, and altered fire regimes. However, we lack clear understanding of how these treatments impact PIJA populations.  

Management priorities for PIJA in Oregon include assessing impacts of juniper treatments on PIJA and determining state-wide distribution. The primary goals of this project are to experimentally study how juniper treatments impact occupancy, habitat use, and nesting of PIJA on BLM lands in Deschutes County, Oregon. We are implementing a before-after-control-impact study and use bioacoustics monitoring, point counts, and nest searching methods. The MS project will focus on at least one component of the project. This work is in partnership with the East Cascades Bird Alliance, US Fish and Wildlife, and Deschutes BLM. We also contribute to the PIJA Western Working Group and the PIJA Conservation Action Strategy (CAS). The MS candidate will be expected to coordinate with and contribute findings to larger range-wide intiatives. 

LOCATION & PROGRAM: This position supports a student in the Masters of Science in Natural Resources at Oregon Tech in Klamath Falls, OR. Our MS program started in 2024 and is in the Natural Sciences Department, which also encompasses the MS of Medical Science program, and BS programs in Environmental Science and Biology-Health Science. Program description and requirements are here https://www.oit.edu/academics/degrees/natural-resources 

SUPPORT: This position includes the opportunity for a Graduate Teaching Assistantship for the Academic Years 2026-2026 and 2027-2028. The GTA will teach labs in the 200-level Principles of Biology series for majors, &/or similar courses within the students expertise. GTAs cover two 3-hour sections per term. Oregon Tech is on a quarter system. Fall, Winter, and Spring terms are 11 weeks. Our academic year runs from mid-September to Mid-June.  The GTA provides a per-term stipend and partial tuition remission during the academic year (Fall through Spring terms). In addition, this research assistantship will provide additional part-time stipend during the spring term, and full-time hourly salary over the summer. Some travel costs from Klamath Falls to Bend, OR will be covered. The graduate student will be expected to use their own vehicle, preferably one that can handle rugged, rocky roads to access field sites. If the student would prefer to forgo the GTA position and cover their own academic costs, that would be an option. 

POSITION REQUIREMENTS: The candidate should have a Bachelors degree in Natural Resources, Wildlife, Ecology, Environmental Science or a closely related program of study and should meet the requirements for acceptance into the Masters of Natural Resources program at Oregon Tech. Ideally, the applicant will have at least 2 years of field experience studying birds, particularly nest searching and point counts. Experience with bioacoustics monitoring (ARUs, BirdNET) will be especially helpful. Additionally, experience doing habitat analyses (Occupancy modeling, RSFs, SDMs) using program R and GIS will be very valuable.  The candidate should have proven ability to work independently in remote areas, and as a member of a team, including supervising undergraduates and working with volunteers. 

 

DATES: Start date is flexible. We are beginning the greater project design and implementation this winter 2026, therefore, the candidate could start as early as March, 2026 as a temporary hire. The academic year begins in mid-September, 2026. 

LOCATION: Oregon Tech is in Klamath Falls, OR, a small rural region of south-central Oregon. The field research about 3 hours north, near Bend and Sisters, Oregon in the east Cascades, sage-steppe biome. This region is famous for its scenic beauty, biodiversity, and outdoor recreation including hiking and trail running, mountain biking, skiing, and water sports.  

APPLICATIONS: Please email a cover letter detailing your experience, interest in the project, and career goals, along with your CV to Jherime.kellermann@oit.edu ASAP.  We will review packages as they are received.

Start Date: May or September 2026                                           Location: Prince George, BC

Project Overview

This collaborative project with the British Columbia Ministry of Forests examines how interacting disturbances and climate change are reshaping forest trajectories in northern British Columbia. Focusing on landscapes affected by windthrow, insect outbreaks, and wildfire, the research aims to understand how disturbance severity and legacy effects influence long-term forest resilience.

The MSc student will investigate how disturbance legacies shape regeneration, stand structure, tree growth, and carbon dynamics using a combination of field-based forest surveys, dendrochronology (tree growth analysis), and geospatial tools, including drone-based lidar and satellite remote sensing. The project integrates ecological theory with applied management questions, providing hands-on experience in field ecology, quantitative analysis, and multi-scale disturbance assessment.

Qualifications

·        BSc (or expected completion) in forestry, ecology, environmental science, geography, or related field

·        Interest in forest disturbance ecology and climate change

·        Experience with fieldwork in forest ecosystems

Research Project: The Emerging Pests and Pathogens Research Unit (EPPRU) is seeking a motivated Post Doctoral fellow to participate in a multi-disciplinary research program focused on the molecular biology of plant pathogenic bacteria. Projects within this research unit are generally aimed at solving questions related to the biology of plant pathogens and cover a range of applied and fundamental research topics. The research opportunities for this postdoc will be centered around investigating a new source of genetic disease resistance in potatoes. This resistance trait was identified and mapped in Solanum microdontum (Mcd) by its ability to protect tubers from bacterial soft rot disease.  There are three important questions that need to be addressed to prepare the germplasm for use in applied breeding programs:

Does Mcd resistance provide protection from other potato pathogens;
Does Mcd resistance provide protection to stems, leaves, and other tissues;
What genes are responsible for Mcd resistance. 
For additional background about this project see: doi: 10.1094/PHYTO-05-23-0158-R and doi: 10.1007/s12230-021-09859-8.  

Learning Objectives: The postdoc will have the opportunity to learn advanced bacterial molecular genetics, biochemistry, next-generation sequencing methods and functional genomics, fluorescence microscopy, plant pathology, molecular plant-microbe interactions, and other skills related to developing an independent research program. The postdoc will be encouraged to attend professional conferences to present research results, participate in grant writing, and contribute to writing manuscripts. The research will take place in a USDA-ARS lab located in the Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology Section of Cornell University’s School of Integrative Plant Science, providing a dynamic and inspiring environment with a range of programs to support their professional development.

Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Bryan Swingle (bryan.swingle@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $73,000 annually.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

Undergraduate Opportunities
Description
The Hubbard Brook Research Foundation, with funding from the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program, anticipates openings for students in the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program during the summer of 2026. One of those openings will be devoted to assisting with the long-term monitoring of forest insects present in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF). 

Students will work with research teams involving other undergraduate and graduate students, studying the biota and ecology of HBEF. The REU students will develop and conduct an independent research project under the supervision of their mentor. Many REU students continue their work as an independent study or senior honors thesis at their home institution. Additionally, through weekly on-site presentations given by the mentors and other scientists, students are also exposed to a full spectrum of ecosystem research at Hubbard Brook. The program runs from late May to mid-August. Students receive a stipend of $5500 for the 10-week program, as well as housing. Limited funding is available for research supplies and travel expenses. Students live at HBRF’s researcher housing adjacent to HBEF, among a community of summer field students and technicians. All residents are expected to share and cooperate with cleaning, cooking, and related chores.
 Lepidoptera / Forest insect community: This project aims to understand more about the Lepidoptera (moths and caterpillars) community, the most important herbivores in northern hardwood forests and a critical link from plant production to consumers like birds and bats. We will work with the insect-REU student to develop a project that may include elements such as building a photographic library of the moths and caterpillars within Hubbard Brook, collecting forest insect samples using various field methods, developing both manual and AI-assisted methods for identifying and enumerating moths (and other insect orders), as well as other research avenues to be determined by the student and mentors. Due to the Lepidoptera and forest insect work being closely linked to bird and bat research, the student will learn and participate in long-term bird research including nest searching and counting food availability, as well as participate in bat research and bioacoustics monitoring. Through this opportunity, the student will have ample access to a multitude of research questions to explore and a chance to contribute to new knowledge in forest ecosystem dynamics.
 In your application, please include: a letter explaining why a summer research project interests you and how it fits into your broader plans, your resume and email contact for two references (they do not need to submit letters). Applications are due by March 6.

If interested in the position, please send your application to Dr. Matt Ayres (Dartmouth College: matthew.p.ayres@dartmouth.edu) and Jessica Jones (Dartmouth College: jessica.s.jones.gr@dartmouth.edu).

Description

This recruitment will be used to fill one full-time Temporary Biological Sciences Research Technician 1 position for the Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society at Oregon State University (OSU). This position is located in Coos Bay, Oregon.

This position will support field data collection associated with a graduate research project focused on the effects of forest edges on Marbled Murrelet nesting habitat at the Elliott State Research Forest in the Central Coast Range of Oregon. The project PI is Meg Krawchuk, and the project team includes a diverse team of scientists. The position will join the Department of Forest Ecosystems & Society, in the College of Forestry. The goal of this project is to evaluate the effects of different forest edge types on various indicators of habitat quality in potential Marbled Murrelet stands. These indicators include canopy microclimate, nest predator abundance (such as ravens and jays), and epiphyte community characteristics. The results from this study aim to inform future management of Marbled Murrelet habitat in Oregon and present a better understanding of edge effects on the species.

The position will assist a graduate student by providing ground support for tree climbers, taking tree and vegetation measurements, and deploying and maintaining autonomous recording units (ARUs) at field sites. Field conditions for this project include steep terrain and can include navigation through challenging vegetation.

Breakdown of work duties:
25% – Assisting with ground support for tree climber(s), including but not limited to: assisting with transporting climbing gear from work vehicle to field sites, helping keep ropes untangled on the ground, fastening field equipment and tools to climbing rope for climber to use in the canopy (including the tying of several basic knots and hitches), and alerting tree climber of any hazards during climbing.

25% – Programming and deploying autonomous recording units (ARUs) at various field sites in the project area. This includes ensuring each unit has fully charged batteries and correct recording settings before deployment and performing maintenance checks when necessary.

30% - Performing inventories of understory composition (e.g. as a percentage of fruiting ground plants in a 10-meter radius circular plot at transect locations).

20% – Data recording using paper datasheets, following established protocols.Field work requires driving between field site locations.


This position requires the ability to work long hours outdoors in in all weather conditions in a remote forested environment. The ability to traverse steep, rugged, and/or uneven terrain is required.

The anticipated required work schedule will be 4 days on and 3 days off, with workdays typically lasting 10 hours. There may be some degree of variability. The field season starts in early-April and concludes in early to mid-September.

Lodging during fieldwork for the first part of the field season (early April into May) will be in hotels or Airbnb’s near the Elliott State Research Forest (likely in Reedsport or Coos Bay). However, some overnight camping will be required later in the field season, which we will do at one of several dedicated camping sites in the forest (there are no facilities, so we will bring our own water, food, and toiletries for a given work week).

Required Qualifications
Two years of college-level courses in forestry, natural resources or closely related field; OR an equivalent combination of training and experience.
Must possess good interpersonal skills and be able to work independently for long hours outdoors, and as part of a team.
Must possess a strong attention to detail.
Experience with fieldwork under strenuous conditions, including steep terrain, and demonstrated capacity to work in a range of weather conditions.
Ability to work collaboratively and respectfully with colleagues, partners, and stakeholders from various backgrounds.

This position requires driving a university vehicle or a personal vehicle on behalf of the university; therefore, the incumbent must successfully complete a motor vehicle history check, possess and maintain a current, valid driver’s license in their state of residence, be determined to be position qualified and self-report convictions as per University Policy 05-030.

Preferred Qualifications
Experience working in the Oregon Coast Range.
Experience conducting understory vegetation surveys.
Interest or experience working with autonomous recording units (ARUs) and maintaining them throughout a field season (replacing batteries and SD cards).
Interest or experience working with tree climbers or arborists or assisting with arboreal work.
Experience working long field seasons (4+ months).

Position Description
The Collaborative Conservation & Adaptation Planning and the Wetland and Riparian Ecology labs at Auburn University are seeking a full-time Postdoctoral Research Fellow to join the “Building the resilience of Gulf Coast blue economies in a changing world: A multiple case study” research initiative, which has been recommended for funding by Mississippi Alabama Sea Grant (*this post was made in anticipation of receiving final approval from the NOAA grants office). This mixed-methods project will constructively evaluate the long-term impacts of Sea Grant’s Gulf Resilience Community of Practice (CoP) and explore how resilience is understood, experienced, and implemented across a spectrum of coastal economies in Mississippi and Alabama.

The postdoc will work closely with Dr. Matthew Jurjonas (PI and Assistant Professor, Conservation Social Science) and Dr. Chris Anderson (Co-PI and Professor, Coastal Wetland Ecology) to co-lead project implementation. The position emphasizes community-based fieldwork, qualitative interviewing, focus groups, and comparative case study analysis, with three focal communities who have already expressed support for the project—representing a range of traditional, hybrid, and tourism-based blue economies. In addition, this position will help co-design a workshop at the CoP annual meeting designed to share results, foster dialogue, and strategize new directions for today’s changing coastal resilience context toward the end of the project.

The position will start in the Spring 2026, and the starting salary is $55,000. In addition, the position includes an annual research and travel budget to support fieldwork, professional development, and dissemination activities.

Key Responsibilities
Develop and implement a program evaluation protocol that constructively evaluates the impact, potential opportunities, and future directions of the Resilience CoP.  
Collaboratively refine and implement a robust qualitative multiple case study design based on Yin’s methodology in three Gulf Coast Communities
Yin, R. K. (2018). Case study research and applications (Vol. 6). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.
Facilitate ongoing coordination with Resilience Extensionists and Gulf Resilience CoP members.

Contribute to the development of peer-reviewed publications, a practitioner-focused policy brief, and outreach materials.
Participate in regular team meetings, project planning, and stakeholder engagement.
Present findings at national and regional conferences (e.g., Gulf of America Alliance, Social Coast Forum, International Association for Society and Natural Resources).

Qualifications
Required:
PhD in Environmental Social Science, Human Dimensions, Geography, Sociology, Public Policy, or a related field by the start date.
Demonstrated experience conducting qualitative research (e.g., interviews, coding, case study design).
Strong writing skills with a track record of scholarly publication.
Interest in community resilience, adaptation, and coastal blue economies.
Experience working with diverse partners, including government agencies, extension, and NGOs.
Interest in contributing to the CCAP lab’s culture of collaborative community-engaged science.

The Southeast Bat Hub (SE Bat Hub) based at Clemson University has primary goals of increasing ecological bat knowledge, bat monitoring, and participation in the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) across the Southeastern US and seeks to hire one experienced full-time bat biologist / data scientist to assist a variety of bat ecology research. Our Hub is currently leading bat monitoring efforts and ecological analyses at military installations and national forests and assists small- to large-scale projects across the region. We emphasize collecting and maintaining quality data, streamlining processes through software and tools developed in-house, and easing participation in NABat. Much of our work and services involve acoustic monitoring and acoustic data processing, though we frequently work with all bat monitoring data (mist netting, roost and emergence counts, etc.), geospatial data, and survey metadata and perform statistical analyses.

An ideal candidate will have experience with acoustic monitoring and one additional bat monitoring method, extensive data management skills, and be familiar with writing code to work with data. Approximately 75% of work will be in the office with the remainder in the field, but this balance will vary across the year. Compensation includes a benefits package with health insurance and retirement savings options. There may also be opportunities to attend professional conferences and regional bat-related events. Position is funded for 7 months and we anticipate future funding for a potential extension of the appointment.

Responsibilities
·         Manage, process, and format data from an assortment of bat survey methods.
·         Implement rigorous data quality assurance/quality control measures and follow organization frameworks.
·         Maintain bat survey equipment and perform a variety of bat field surveys (acoustic, roost counts, mist netting, radio telemetry tagging and tracking, etc.) and vegetation identification and measurements, which will include some overnight travel (<25%).
·         Utilize open-source and internally developed software and report bugs and requests for additional features. Assist with development of our tools, primarily in Python and R programming languages.
·         Update and create GIS maps and products, perform spatial analyses (ideally with ArcGIS, QGIS, and GeoPandas or ArcPy), and manage ArcGIS online data and digital survey forms such as Survey123.
·         Regularly cooperate with Hub coordinator and principal investigators to manage multiple, simultaneous projects.
·         Effectively communicate with current and potential federal, tribal, state, and NGO partners, sub-contractors, and the public. 
·         Work with data in cloud storage, upload data to NABat, and manage and resolve errors with NABat partner portal projects.
·         Occasionally assist Hub coordinator with statistical analyses, report writing, website publications and updates, and professional presentations and outreach events (virtual and in-person).

Preferred Experience
·         Master’s degree in wildlife ecology, biology, environmental data science, or related field or bachelor’s and 2+ years of relevant experience.
·         Strong attention to detail and skills in data management and quality assurance/quality control, especially with scientific data.
·         Familiarity with bat acoustic data processing and manual vetting echolocation calls of Southeastern US bat species is desirable.
·         Ability to work independently and in groups in the field and the office and willingness to travel for multiple consecutive days (<25% of monthly activities).
·         Ability to traverse rough, uneven terrain while navigating in backcountry for up to a few miles on foot.
·         Modern smartphone with data plan to utilize our survey forms in the field.
·         Valid US class C driver's license and experience operating a 4-wheel drive vehicle on narrow, unmaintained roads.
·         Willingness to get a rabies pre-exposure vaccination and/or an up-to-date rabies titer (cost will be covered if needed).
·         Well-rounded, diverse experience is highly valued.

Disclaimers
·         Housing is not provided.
·         Occasional day/night outdoor work in moderate to strenuous conditions, potentially involving adverse weather, cold or hot and humid conditions, insects, and toxic plants.
·         Some overnight travel will be required (<25%), during which housing, per diem, and a field vehicle will be provided.

 Description 

The Young lab at Utah State University is seeking three (3) black bear hair snare technicians to assist with the Baldwin Bear Project. The Baldwin Bear Project is a collaborative research project with the Michigan DNR, looking at the socioecological systems of black bears. The technicians will primarily assist a master’s student, in her study determining the density of black bears and analyzing their movements in the Baldwin Bear Management Unit of the Northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. This study area includes most of the landscape between Grand Rapids and Traverse City. The technicians are expected to start on 4 May and work until 31 July 2026. 

Technicians will assist with repairing established hair snares using barbed wire, creating rub trees using duct tape, setting up camera traps, collecting hair samples and maintaining hair snares, tree rubs, and camera traps. Technicians will also assist with removing the hair snare sites at the end of the season. The technicians must follow specific protocols for the hair snares and hair collection. Applicants should expect some long days while setting up/tearing down hair snares and be able to carry 40+ pounds of barbed wire and other gear into relatively thick brush and swampy bottomlands. 

This area of Michigan has mild topography, and applicants should be able to traverse through it while carrying a heavy pack.

Technicians must be aware of their surroundings and be confident hiking alone where carnivores and other wildlife species are present. Applicants must also be comfortable handling pungent lures, and oil for baiting the hair snare sites. 

Additional fieldwork related to the study may include helping a Ph. D student and another MS student with human dimensions related tasks which could include being comfortable interacting with strangers (e.g., to conduct social science survey research) and be willing to assist with door to door survey requests. 

Field housing will be provided in the form of a camper trailer. Campers have cooktops and microwaves and will be stationed at a DNR office or a state park with accessible bathrooms and showers. Applicants are encouraged to bring bedding, field clothes, boots, and other gear needed to work in the summer heat. Long pants and long sleeves are encouraged. Rubber work boots and leather gloves will be provided if needed, along with bear spray. Work vehicle(s) will be provided for fieldwork and essential travel and will be shared between technicians. Crew members will be expected to use a personal vehicle for recreation and personal errands/travel during their time off. Exact start and end dates are flexible, but our preferred dates are early May through late July. 

Minimum Qualifications 

· Working towards a degree in wildlife ecology/management, biology, natural resources, or a similar field OR be able to demonstrate equivalent experience.

Description
 Overview

The Guam Department of Agriculture's Division of Aquatic & Wildlife Resources (DAWR) is looking for a Wildlife Biologist to add to the Wildlife Office team! DAWR is tasked with protecting Guam’s natural resources by working through partnerships to conserve and manage fish and wildlife and their habitats for the use and enjoyment of current and future generations. In particular, the Wildlife Office works closely with Guam's native bird and bat species, specifically the Guam rail (Ko'ko'), Guam kingfisher (Sihek), Micronesian Starling (Såli), Mariana swiftlet (Yayaguak), Mariana moorhen (Pulattat), and Mariana fruit bat (Fanihi). We also work to educate the public about invasive species such as the brown treensnake and the threats they pose to native wildlife. DAWR also collaborates with federal agencies and local environmental groups on conservation projects in pursuit of wildlife restoration on Guam.

Details & Responsibilities

This person will contribute to DAWR's monitoring of Guam's native bird and bat species. Avian monitoring methods include point count surveys, audio playbacks and recordings, camera trapping, nest monitoring, and radio telemetry. Bat colonies are monitored via roost counts and flyover surveys. The majority of work will take place in the field, primarily on Islan Dåno' (Cocos Island), a small islet off the southern coast of Guam (daily boat transportation provided) but also in other forest and watershed habitats across Guam. This will include species identification and monitoring, data collection, and maintenance of equipment and survey stations. Additionally, this person will be responsible for data entry and database management in the office, and will assist with data analysis and report writing.

Biologists also participate in public outreach events and classroom visits with trained education birds. On a limited basis, this person may also assist in husbandry for DAWR's captive breeding programs of Guam rail and Guam kingfisher. There may be opportunities for additional trainings and off-island travel for conferences and workshops.

Benefits

This is a full-time, permanent position with the Government of Guam and comes with full health care and retirement benefits, sick leave, holidays, and vacation hours. We will likely be able to provide some relocation assistance, such as a one-way plane ticket to Guam and a small sum for other relocation expenses, though we cannot guarantee this at this time.

Qualifications
 
Applicants must have graduated from a recognized college or university with a Bachelor’s degree in biology, wildlife science, fishery science, zoology or related fields. Applicants must also have a valid U.S. driver's license, and be prepared to work outdoors in Guam's hot, humid, tropical climate.
 
Preferred experience: 
· field experience in avian monitoring techniques 
· experience with ARUs, trail cameras, GPS, and radio telemetry 
· experience with basic statistical analysis and report writing 
· familiarity with Guam's ecosystems and species 
· the ability to work both independently and as part of a team 
· a strong work ethic, and a willingness to learn
