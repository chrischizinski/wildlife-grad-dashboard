USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Forest Service Northern Research Station (NRS), Northern Forest Climate Hub (NFCH) located in Houghton, Michigan.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: A fellowship opportunity is available with the USDA Northern Forest Climate Hub (NFCH) to provide useable science and technology on climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation responses to meet the needs of communities and natural resources professionals across the Midwest and Northeast US. The primary focus of this fellowship is to create an ecosystem vulnerability assessment for priority terrestrial ecosystems across the Midwest and Northeast US. The assessment will synthesize current information from ecosystem models, published research, Indigenous Knowledge, and land managers, building on previous efforts and adopting contemporary approaches for accessibility and use. The assessment will serve as a synthesis of the best available science on climate change impacts and the vulnerability of ecosystems in the Midwest and Northeast US (20-state area corresponding to the FS Eastern Region). This information will be prepared for professional land managers, forest practitioners, land stewards, and others seeking information to integrate climate change considerations into planning and management. Notable applications include National Forest and Grassland Management Plans, State Forest Action Plans, and project-level ecosystem management. 

The fellow will be a part of a team of NFCH to prepare the assessment. The fellow will also collaborate with partners across other agencies and institutions, including federal, state, tribal, conservation organizations, forest sector, and universities.  It will be essential for the fellow to balance multiple responsibilities, to clearly communicate with team members, and to be flexible to shifting priorities. The primary learning experience for the fellow will be to review literature and help write major portions of the vulnerability assessment. The fellow will be a lead author for multiple assessment chapters. Supplemental learning opportunities for the fellow will include analyzing data, developing web tools, facilitating meetings, delivering presentations, and designing outreach materials.

Learning Objectives: 

The participant will learn scientific and technical knowledge related to climate change trends, projections, ecosystem impacts, management implications, ecosystem vulnerability, and various implications to society. The participant will gather and apply information across a 20-state region of the Midwest and Northeast US.  
The participant will learn best practices for communicating technical scientific information to a professional audience, including preparing a large assessment for publication as a Forest Service General Technical Report, developing companion online tools and outreach products, and delivering presentations to diverse audiences.

Description
This one-year position, open only to US citizens, will involve organizing and participating in biweekly field expeditions for Ekipa Fanihy with one additional tech (also from the US) and a team of Malagasy PhD students from the University of Antananarivo. This position will take over from one of our outgoing techs and overlap a current tech who will remain through December 2025 and be replaced in January 2026.

Ekipa Fanihy carries out capture and sampling of Madagascar’s fruit bats (Pteropus rufus, Eidolon dupreanum, and Rousettus madagascariensis) at roost sites in the District of Moramanga, Madagascar, with possible extensions to field sites elsewhere. This work supports a long-term field study based in the Brook Lab at UC Berkeley, which aims to decipher the mechanisms underpinning persistence of potentially zoonotic RNA viruses in wild, Madagascar fruit bats. Bats are reservoirs for several important, highly-virulent zoonoses, including rabies, Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, and SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses. This work also contributes data to population viability analyses and assessments of the conservation status of threatened fruit bats in Madagascar. Please see the Brook Lab website for further details about the major themes of the project.

Field technicians will be trained in the field in September 2025 by project PI, Professor Cara Brook, and one current technician on the job, then supervised remotely (from UC Berkeley) for the duration of the year, interspersed with regular visits from Dr. Brook and other members of the Brook lab.

Techs will spend approximately 70% of their time in the field. During each field mission, techs will travel with University of Antananarivo PhD students for up to 1-2 days to remote field sites in vehicles with hired drivers. While in the field, the team will reside in tents provided by the project for up to two weeks at a time. The work will necessitate strenuous hiking and hauling heavy equipment, sometimes in adverse weather conditions. During field missions, a local cook will be hired to prepare meals, and all expenses (including food) will be funded by the project.

While in the field, the field team will capture bats, collect biological samples (blood, urine, feces, saliva, ectoparasites, wing punches), and undertake basic sample preparation (i.e. centrifugation) and storage in liquid nitrogen. The work will be unevenly paced with periods of intense work interspersed with significant downtime; techs will need to be prepared to entertain themselves during this downtime with reading, writing, personal research projects, studying Malagasy, etc. Many field missions will overlap traditional weekends, and techs will be expected to work during these periods.

In between field missions (30% of the time), techs will live in a shared house in Madagascar’s capital city of Antananarivo (housing includes a modern kitchen, ample living space, modern bathroom, WiFi, on-site security, and monthly cleaning services). Each tech will be provided a private bedroom. In Antananarivo (‘Tana’), the techs will work with Ekipa Fanihy to further treat, organize, and conduct basic molecular analyses (DNA/RNA extractions, PCR, etc.) of samples at our laboratory at Madagascar Biodiversity Center. Together, the two field techs will be additionally responsible for restocking, packing, and preparation of field supplies for recurring field missions. When weekends overlap with periods of time in the city, techs will have free time to travel locally, take Malagasy lessons, and reset as needed.

When not in the field, techs will additionally have opportunities to take part in professional development in the form of remote lab meetings with the Brook Lab at UC Berkeley, as well as receive guidance on the graduate school application process if desired. Field technicians will be acknowledged on publications arising from this work and may or may not be included as co-authors depending on the duration of their employment and the extent of their intellectual contributions to data analysis and interpretation after the field work concludes. Opportunities for independent work–either in science communication or in research–may be pursued on a case-by-case basis.

Please visit the Brook Lab News page to read prior field technician Katherine McFerrin’s blog post, summarizing “A Day in the Life of a Field Project Manager” to read what life is like for our team in the field. Feel free to reach out to contact current and former Ekipa Fanihy field technicians, Monique Ades (at mnades06@gmail.com) or Martin Roland (at martincroland@gmail.com), with any questions about the job.

 What We Can Achieve Together:

The Science for Nature and People Partnership (SNAPP), a collaboration between The Nature Conservancy and Wildlife Conservation Society, has joined the Doris Duke Foundation in an innovative partnership, known as the SNAPP Innovation Hub, to develop strategies and priorities to advance nature-positive solutions in the United States. The SNAPP Innovation Hub combines one regional and two distinct perspectives on US national priorities through interdisciplinary working groups led by Principal Investigators (PI’s) holding positions at different institutions in the US. All working group members will convene October 20-24, 2025, and Fall 2026 at a pre-arranged time and place to both pursue their independent agendas and intentionally cultivate cross-group synergies. The Nature Conservancy is seeking three full-time post-doctoral Research Fellows, each with a unique set of skills and experience. The Research Fellows will coordinate working group research and coalition building, as well as administer arrangements for working group convenings and work products.

All three SNAPP Research Fellows will be hired by The Nature Conservancy’s Global Science Business Unit’s Science Capacity Team and will report to the SNAPP Program Manager for working group coordination. Research will be conducted under the guidance of the working group's Principal Investigators and members. All SNAPP Research Fellows will be co-mentored by a team of scientists, including the SNAPP Director and working group Principal Investigators.

The SNAPP Research Fellow will synthesize existing biophysical models and scientific literature related to the timing and extent of Gulf tidal wetland transformation along the Gulf coast counties of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas related to TNC’s Restoration, Adaptive Management, and Protection for Future Wetlands (RAMP for Wetlands) initiative. They will incorporate information about time scales, tipping points, biodiversity, and socioeconomic information into TNC’s Gulf Resilient Coastal Sites (RCS) data set.  The SNAPP Research Fellow will also conduct legal and policy research, as well as coordinate with agencies and partners.

This opportunity is intended for Ph.D. post-graduates as the next immediate step in their scientific career. The ideal candidate will have a Ph.D. in a related science field with the Ph.D. awarded by the start date of the position, with demonstrated subject matter expertise related to the specific working group focus. They have an interest in conservation science, both ecological and human dimensions, and desire to contribute towards innovative and impactful science that will enhance scientific and conservation priorities and contribute to building resilience in the United States. They have experience working collaboratively, have diverse cultural experiences, and are keen to contribute to TNC and partner organization effectiveness as science-based organizations.


This is a 15-month term-limited position, expected to start on or before October 1, 2025. The location for this position is expected to be in Mobile, Alabama, at the University of South Alabama’s Stokes School of Marine & Environmental Sciences.
The successful candidate will have authorization to work within the United States where they are located. Additionally, SNAPP Innovation Hub Research Fellows are required to attend two in-person Hub convenings (#1 Hillsborough, NJ, Oct 2025, #2 Location TBD, Oct./Nov 2026) and an in-person SNAPP Research Fellows cohort professional development and networking opportunity (Arlington, VA, early 2026).   This prestigious fellowship comes with additional opportunities funded through the SNAPP program and The Nature Conservancy’s Global Science, Science Capacity Team. All members of the cohort will have access to extensive training and professional development opportunities during their tenure.
The SNAPP Innovation Hub Research Fellow reviews and synthesizes scientific literature and existing datasets to advance the research questions of the Future Tidal Wetlands working group. They analyze data, write reports, and develop proposals to support conservation efforts. They may design empirical strategies, identify data protocols to test hypotheses, evaluate outcomes, and contribute to the development of new theories of change. They collect, manage, and analyze data and write up findings for peer-reviewed publications. They coordinate the project management of their working group’s research and are responsible for meeting arrangement administration for their working group, including, but not limited to, managing virtual meeting platforms and coordinating flights, hotel reservations, and reimbursements, as well as engaging facilitators and supporting meeting agenda creation and execution. They also contribute to the broader Innovation Hub synthesis and cohort-building and provide project updates regularly to communications staff and program funders.

Description
The lab of Urban Plant Ecology at Cornell University is seeking a postdoctoral researcher to lead research projects. This work will primarily involve conducting large-scale data synthesis projects to better understand the drivers of urban metacommunities and biodiversity patterns. In particular, the lab is interested in understanding the drivers of biotic heterogeneity in urban environments and the spatial/temporal dynamics of these drivers. This will involve working with pre-existing data collected by the lab, as well as collaborator data and publicly available data from an array of cities. As such, the postdoc should have strong experience working with large datasets, modeling ecological data, and maintaining national/international collaborations. The postdoc will have a relatively high degree of autonomy in developing research projects and directions, in concert with Aaron Sexton, lab PI. If interested, the postdoc could also join in data collection in ongoing field research projects, but this will not encompass a majority of the researcher’s time. Opportunities exist for informal mentoring of graduate and undergraduate research students. Start date is expected to be November 2025. This position will be located in Ithaca, New York with the potential of working a hybrid schedule, depending on needs. More information about the lab is available on the website at https://aaronsexton.com/ .

Working independently within your assigned region, you'll build strong relationships with WDFW teams, local partners, and stakeholders while staying in close communication with leadership on emerging, sensitive, or high-profile issues. This is a dynamic, field-focused position where environmental stewardship, community engagement, and regulatory expertise intersect.

Work in an environment teeming with untouched natural beauty and incredible wildlife.
Gain hands-on research experience in a largely understudied region with enormous potential.  

What We’re Looking For:  
A student or recent graduate in Social Media Marketing, Digital Marketing, or a related field.
Passion for wildlife, storytelling, and making a positive impact.
Creative and proactive approach to managing and growing social media platforms.
Experience with photography, videography, or graphic design is a plus.

   Comfortable accommodation will be provided during your stay.

Transportation: Pick-up from and drop-off at the Polokwane airport, weekly or bi-weekly town trips for students to restock supplies, and daily drives around the reserve.

This fee ensures that your experience contributes to both your well-being and the vital work of preserving the reserve.

Duration of Stay:  
Flexible | We recommend a commitment of 2 to 4 months to fully immerse yourself in the experience.
