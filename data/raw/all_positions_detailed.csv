This position will be seated in the University of Idaho (UI) College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Department of Animal, Veterinary and Food Sciences; however, will be based at the UI Nancy M. Cummings Research, Extension and Education Center (NMCREEC) near Salmon, Idaho. Research activities will be in collaboration with the USDA-ARS-US Sheep Experiment Station (USSES) near Dubois, Idaho and the Idaho Wild Sheep Foundation. Applicants should be aware that although research activities associated with this position are local to NMCREEC and USSES, coursework will predominantly be completed remotely. As part of a grant funded research project, this position will be responsible for carrying out research in developing, testing, and applying novel domestic sheep-specific virtual/remote monitoring and herding technology for application in remote rangelands. The outcomes of this research will contribute to understanding sheep behavior using virtual herding tools and ultimately provide management solutions for grazing sheep on open ranges; in particular, in areas where habitat overlap conflicts may occur with wild sheep. Through this project, the successful candidate will have the opportunity to work on a uniquely diverse, multidisciplinary project to gain skills and networks in the disciplines of range science, livestock management, agricultural technology, geospatial mapping, and wildlife habitat. Within reason, coursework and additional project objectives will be personalized to fit the student’s interests and career objectives.  The successful candidate may have the opportunity to develop and execute their own relevant research objective(s) that will complement the funded research. Professional development opportunities will include scientific design and implementation, scientific writing for peer-reviewed journals, attending and presenting at scientific and stakeholder meetings, stakeholder engagement and outreach, multidisciplinary training and networking, team leadership and management, and project coordination, among others. 
 Position Qualifications:
The successful candidate must hold a completed Bachelor’s degree in a related field prior to starting this position. This position will require excellent leadership and communication skills. Applicants must also have excellent interpersonal skills, attention to detail, a strong work ethic, a valid driver’s license, a willingness to conduct field research under rigorous and remote conditions during variable weather conditions, and a willingness to drive to and stay at field site locations. Preference will be given to applicants that demonstrate a passion for the livestock ranching industry, have working knowledge in grazing livestock behavior, and have experience in livestock handling, remote-sensing technologies, geographic mapping (such as ArcGIS or onX) and/or vegetation monitoring. Preference will also be given to applicants with skills in horse riding, backcountry hiking, camping, and survival. Applicants with an established history of publication and/or experience presenting research findings or to stakeholder groups will also be given preference. Experience with any of the following is also beneficial: working/living in rural areas, working on ranching/farming operations and/or as a range technician, and operating ATV/UTVs and 4WD vehicles, and towing trailers.
 Housing:
In addition to the stipend, this position offers housing in an on-site dormitory with individual sleeping area and a common living area with other graduate students or seasonal interns/technicians (successful candidate will not be required to stay in the dormitory).

Description
The School of Natural Resources and the Environment at West Virginia University is searching for a Master of Science (MS) student to determine occupancy and abundance of songbirds on recently (3-8 years) harvested forest stands during spring and fall migration on institutional private forests in West Virginia. Understanding how these young forest stands contribute as stopover habitat for migrating songbirds is of critical importance. This project provides a unique opportunity to evaluate use of regenerating forest stands by migrating songbirds in a large and patchily disturbed landscape. The student will determine occupancy and abundance using mist-nets and using Autonomous Recording Units (ARUs). The student will use pre-existing models to identify study areas. This research is in collaboration with National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc., National Alliance of Forest Owners, and Weyerhaeuser Company under the auspices of the Wildlife Conservation Initiative, and Cornell University. 

The student will be working towards an MS in Wildlife and Fisheries Resources at West Virginia University. STARTING DATE: August 2025. The ideal applicant must be able to identify central Appalachian avian species by sight and sound and have extensive experience with mist-netting and handling birds. Applicants should also be familiar with collecting measurements of forest structure, including but not limited to: DBH, canopy cover (using spherical densiometers), Robel pole, Daubenmire frame, etc. Preference will be given to applicants with experience in R statistical packages, GIS, and song file analysis via RavenPro or similar software. Applicants should be comfortable working long days in the field during spring and fall months, ready to travel, and energetic and excited about applied avian conservation research on private working forests. Applicants will also be responsible for hiring and supervising a research technician to assist with research duties. Applicants must have completed a BS in Wildlife Biology, Ecology, or a closely related field. A minimum of 300 combined GRE score (V+Q) or 1100 on the previous scale, and a minimum 3.25 GPA are considered competitive. 

Tuition waiver is included.

To Apply: Electronic applications are preferred. To apply send a single file including: 1) a cover letter outlining any relevant mist-netting and bird handling experience, 2) resumé including an unofficial copy of transcripts and GRE scores, and 3) contact information for 3 references to Dr. Chris Lituma; cml0017@mail.wvu.edu

Description
 *Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Forest Service Southern Research Station (SRS) located in Durham, North Carolina. The opportunity may be remote.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

The mission of the United States Forest Service (USFS) Southern Research Station (SRS) is to create science and technology needed to sustain and enhance forest ecosystems and the benefits they provide. The Center for Economics and Social Science (CESS), located within USFS-SRS, includes the Forest Economics and Policy Unit (RWU-4804). The research mission of the unit is to advance the science between natural and human-caused disturbances and economic values, and how those disturbances can be managed to reduce undesired impacts on society and ecosystems.

Research Project: The Forest Economic and Policy Unit is seeking an ORISE participant to help quantify the economic effectiveness of wildfire prevention programs (and their associated “activities”) at reducing human-caused wildfires on Tribal lands in the United States. The purpose of this experience will be to quantify temporal and spatial effects of fire prevention programs on human ignitions by including individual management practices from a time series dataset. We expect that the participant will use econometric methods to approach this research objective.

Learning Objectives: The ORISE participant will learn about relevant fire prevention programs, fire prevention activities, and associated datasets. In addition, the participant will receive guidance with novel econometric techniques, and receive support with scientific writing.

The participant will have the opportunity to collaborate and receive mentorship from scientists and mangers in USFS and Bureau of Indian Affairs. The participant will develop scientific writing and econometric skills, as well as increase proficiency using statistical software (such as STATA or R). The mentor will encourage dissemination of results among managers and research groups.  

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Sonia Bruck (sonia.bruck@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be until December 30, 2025, but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is part time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $3,000-$3,500 per month.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation. Foreign national candidates may have a mandatory in-person requirement depending on visa status.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Questions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email ORISE.USFS.SRS@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.

Qualifications
The qualified candidate should be currently pursuing or have received a master's or postdoctoral degree in the one of the relevant fields (Forestry Economics or Applied Economics). Degree must have been received or be currently pursuing by the start date.

Preferred skills:

Experience with econometric methods, and some knowledge in forestry or wildland fire science.

Description
(This is a grant-funded, one-year, non-tenure track position. Funding must be available for any continuation of appointment.)

Work Location: Department of Entomology, LSU AgCenter, Baton Rouge, LA.

Position Description: In the Diaz Laboratory, we strive to give the best career-building opportunities for our team members; this includes involvement with diverse projects on invasive species and biological control, training on field and laboratory techniques, exposure to international cooperation, mentoring research assistants, establishment multidisciplinary projects, hands-on preparation of technical and non-technical publications, among others. We are seeking a candidate to join our team!

The successful candidate will be responsible for rearing salvinia weevils (Cyrtobagous salviniae) in a greenhouse and open-earthen ponds located in Baton Rouge, LA. Activities will include inoculation of giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) into the ponds, fertilization of plants, weeding, inoculation of weevils, monitoring of pond conditions, and harvest of weevils. Regular pond maintenance will include occasional herbicide and insecticide applications to reduce pest densities. The associate will follow an established quality-control protocol for the mass rearing operation. Water quality data (pH, conductivity, nitrogen levels) and weevil density (adults and larvae counts) will be collected monthly. The associate will work closely with team leaders of LSU AgCenter and Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act (CWPPRA) to coordinate the harvest of weevil-infested salvinia for distribution in coastal parishes. The impact of the biological control program will be monitored at several marshes in coastal Louisiana. The associate will sample several field sites in coastal Louisiana and collect data such as salvinia biomass, submerged aquatic vegetation, water quality, and weevil densities. Monitoring the salvinia control will include the use of drones and satellites. A team of student workers, interns, and graduate students working on salvinia will be available to assist the associate with activities. Therefore, we seek an applicant with experience with managing people, mentoring students, or coordinating projects.

Physical activities related to this job may include but are not limited to: periodic lifting of 20 lbs., mowing perimeter of ponds, using a backpack sprayer, driving state trucks and boats, wading in waist deep water to collect weevil samples, and harvesting ponds. The successful candidate will prepare quarterly reports and will work closely with collaborators in CWPPRA and USFWS.

 BEAR CONSERVATION SPECIALIST


 Teton Country


The Wildlife Restoration Foundation (WRF) Bear Conservation Specialist-Teton Country position is open to qualified individuals passionate about bears and based near Victor, Driggs, Tetonia, and other towns along the Caribou-Targhee National Forest. The position is unpaid, but stipends are available to cover expenses and to reward accomplishments. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will rapidly gain valuable professional experience by playing an integral role on the WRF team. Work to build WRF’s bear conservation capacity and impact on Teton National Park bears as you contribute and strengthen your conservation knowledge and skills. Gain recognition for your efforts among area partners, on the WRF website, and elsewhere, as you participate in meeting WRF’s mission, which is to increase park wildlife population viability both ex situ and in situ, working closely with National Parks and Forests, zoo partners, and park gateway communities.


WRF operates effectively and efficiently and generates resources that enable measurable, boots-on-the-ground conservation results. The WRF Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will focus on implementation of the “I Am Bear Safe” Project in small towns neighboring Teton National Park’s gateway communities in Montana. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will collaborate with the WRF President, Director of Communications, and other team members in connection to the “I Am Bear Safe” Project.


 [https://www.wildlifeandparks.org/projects].


“I Am Bear Safe”™ (IABS) is a multi-partner Wildlife Coexistence Strategy designed to equip National Park gateway community chambers of commerce and their member businesses (“Park Gateway Partners”) to “train people not to train bears” to get in the trouble they are in now because of human behavior—a situation that is assuring bear demise. Bears are a top attraction at many National Parks and are well-managed within the parks to avoid human interaction. But communities at the park’s edge are not sufficiently prepared or equipped for the increasing pressure of more visitors coupled with rapid development, naïve new residents, and a growing number of recreationists in bear country. Park Gateway Partner (PGP) businesses are the perfect intervention point and receive marketing benefits from participating in the IABS town-based bear stewardship effort. WRF provides customized tools (signage and SWAG) that equip PGPs to effectively intercept park visitors and recreationists and equip them to be bear stewards who act responsibly by securing attractants and following park rules for recreating in bear habitat. The IABS goal is that bears perform their natural behaviors and survive without risk and distraction caused by humans.


Responsibilities:

Track the inventory of IABS materials distributed to PGPs in each town.
Distribute IABS Toolkit materials to PGPs and redistribution points.
Recruit new PGPs, as appropriate and assigned.
Field questions and relay PGP concerns to WRF.
Attend meetings of the chamber of commerce or local partner organization on occasion.
Mail out reward IABS reward magnets to Bear Quiz-takers.
Come up with novel ideas to make the IABS Project more effective.

Education & Experience

Bachelor’s degree in a relevant subject is required; graduate degree helpful.
Knowledge and experience specific to grizzly and black bears required.
Experience working with community-based organizations and/or local businesses.

WRF Bear Conservation Specialists are asked to participate in an initial training then designate 16 hours a week to WRF and agree to work with WRF for 4 months. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) Should be a self-starter, ambitious, creative, productive, and dedicated to WRF’s mission. S/he must also exhibit a high degree of professionalism, accountability, and ability to follow instructions and manage time well. S/he should be friendly and approachable, well-spoken, bold, and personable.  The internship is unpaid, but stipends are provided for approved expenses and as results are achieved. 


The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will report to Julie Anton Randall, WRF President. Hours are flexible within the week, with the exception that PGP deliveries and communications best occur during business hours. Participation in biweekly IABS team meetings and occasional full WRF team meetings by Zoom are required.

Please send a short (less than one page) cover letter and resume with references to wildliferestorationvolunteer@gmail.com.  Please name the electronic file as follows: [Date]_BCS-Teton-Country_[Your Name].

Thank you for your dedication to bears and excitement about being part of the Wildlife Restoration Foundation team in Teton Country!

Description
Sea Turtle Care Center Interns have the opportunity to learn about and participate in the rescue, rehabilitation, and release of native sea turtle species. Interns will assist staff in all aspects of the daily care of sick and injured sea turtles, occasional medical procedures, and educational programs.

This allows for the opportunity to learn how to admit a higher number of turtles at one time and to learn valuable hands-on knowledge of a common cause of stranding every winter throughout the country. While local releases are not possible during this time of year due to colder waters, it is possible that you will get the chance to participate in a release in Florida.

We know how difficult it is to commit to an unpaid internship, but we try our best to incorporate as many learning opportunities as possible and to work with you. Our desired schedule is working four days with three consecutive days off. 

We offer professional development workshops in order to help you become a more competitive job candidate.

Reasonable Accommodation Policy-
Federal agencies must provide reasonable accommodation to applicants with disabilities

Commission (EEOC) must provide reasonable accommodations:

job duties or to gain access to the workplace.
 An employee with a disability needs an accommodation to receive equal access to
benefits, such as details, training, and office-sponsored events.
Under the Fair Chance Act, agencies are not allowed to request information about an
applicant’s criminal history until a conditional offer of employment has been made, except
as allowed for access to classified information; assignment to national security duties or
positions; acceptance or retention in the armed forces; or recruitment of a Federal law
enforcement officer. An applicant may submit a complaint or any other information
related to an organization’s alleged noncompliance with the Fair Chance Act. The
complaint must be submitted within 30 calendar days of the date of the alleged
noncompliance. To make a Fair Chance Act inquiry or complaint, send an email with the
appropriate information to MRP.Fairchance@usda.gov subject line: Fair Chance Act.
