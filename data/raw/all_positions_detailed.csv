Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNWRS) located in Wenatchee, Washington.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Together the Forests and the Lab also build decision support tools that support a Forest-wide strategies to create healthy and wildfire adapted forests and a toolkit for evaluating current conditions and adapting them to wildfires and warming.

This project creates updates in a landscape evaluation toolkit, which include new models for listed and sensitive species. These models can inform managers during planning on how to improve forest health and reduce adverse consequences to sensitive species. Revisions also include updating values in the existing models that reflect new science and lessons learned over the last 15-years. The toolkit also includes evaluation tools that show current wildfire risk, overly dense forest conditions, and opportunities for transitioning forest conditions that are adapted to 21st century wildfires and drying environmental conditions through management.

Description
The Wolf Conservation Center (WCC) is seeking one to two part-time technicians to support a behavioral research project focused on captive red wolves. This project is a collaboration between the WCC, Utah State University, and other Saving Animals From Extinction (SAFE) program facilities.

Technicians will assist a graduate student researcher by coding video footage of red wolf breeding pairs using BORIS behavioral analysis software. Footage was recorded during the 2025 breeding season (January–March). Each assigned wolf pair requires 20 minutes of coded footage for every day of recording. Technicians are expected to process approximately 8 days' worth of footage per workday to stay on schedule.  The goal is to assess how pair bond strength and individual behaviors relate to reproductive success in captivity.

This is a remote position. Technicians will use BORIS and R Studio to randomly select and code footage. The expected workload is 20 hours per week, with complete flexibility to set your own schedule as long as project milestones are met.  The duration of the position will depend on how quickly the footage is coded; hiring multiple technicians may significantly shorten the overall timeline.  Applicants must be comfortable working independently and spending long hours reviewing video footage.

Minimum Qualifications:

• Have or be working towards a degree in wildlife ecology/management, zoology, biology, natural resources, or a similar field
• Demonstrated attention to detail, precision, and consistency in observational tasks. Technicians will be responsible for thoroughly understanding and correctly applying an ethogram supplied by the graduate student researcher
• Proactive and self-directed, with the ability to structure a remote work schedule that aligns with project requirements
• Strong organizational and data management skills, with the ability to maintain a consistent file structure and follow detailed protocols. Technicians must manage large volumes of footage, including unused files that may be incorporated later
• Must have a computer or laptop capable of running R studio and BORIS behavioral analysis software
Preferred Qualifications:

• Background in ethology, behavioral ecology, or related biological sciences
• Familiarity with BORIS behavioral software
• Experience distinguishing between conspecific individuals with minimal sexual dimorphism
• Comfort working independently in a remote location

To Apply: Please send a cover letter, resume/CV, and contact information for three references as a single PDF to S. Lovin at s.lovin@usu.edu with “LastName – Breeding Behavior Technician 2025” in the subject line.  Label your file as“LastName_FirstName_BreedingBehaviorTechnician2025.pdf”. Applications will be reviewed starting 22 July 2025.

Start date is flexible, but priority will be given to applicants who can start by 4 August 2025.  Technicians are expected to commit to 20 hours of work per week.  This is a remote position, allowing a flexible schedule.  After training is completed during the first two weeks, technicians will be responsible for managing their time appropriately to ensure the project’s needs are met.
Estimated end date may vary depending on the number of technicians hired—additional personnel could accelerate completion.

Description
 Description

The Great Basin Institute will recruit and support an Administrative Historian who will complete a new administrative history for John Day Fossil Beds National Monument (JODA). The historian at JODA will engage in researching and writing a comprehensive history of how JODA has been managed from 1996 to the present day, including important issues in planning, land acquisition, development, public relations, and other topics of ongoing management concern. The final narrative reference will consist of a scholarly examination of the administrative history of the unit and will serve as a valuable tool for future park managers and scholars. The research effort resulting from this project will significantly expand the site’s reference and archival files and provide additional information for park staff. Finally, the administrative history will be placed on JODA’s website to make the information widely available to the public.
A chronology of land acquisitions, paleontology research, archaeology surveys, park developments, special programs, resource protection and mitigation, and personnel changes are necessary to conduct many aspects of everyday park operations as well as in preparation for the Park’s 50-year anniversary in 2025. There has been a high degree of turnover at the Park recently. As such, there has been a great deal of loss of institutional memory. Having a new administrative history will help capture institutional knowledge and prevent further loss. The historian will create a published scholarly, and comprehensively updated report bridging the gap between the last administrative history report, in 1996, and the present. This report will be a substantial aid in the documentation of the history of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.
Description:
The updated administrative history will include photos and graphics as well as a comprehensive assessment of primary and secondary sources in local, regional, state and national archives.  Oral history interviews will be conducted with present and former NPS staff, park partners, volunteers and others. These interviews will require travel to meet individuals both within the commuting distance of the park and outside of it. The study will be prepared by a professional historian who meets the Secretary of the Interior’s standards for historians and follows the guidelines outlined in Director’s Order 28.
Project Objectives:
This project will result in a published scholarly, and comprehensively updated report bridging the gap between the 1996 report and the present and will be a substantial aid in the documentation of the history of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. This historic report will research and document cultural resources of the park from 1996 to present and is a baseline document. As appropriate, data from this research and the archive of the 1997 administrative history will be added to the park archives and entered into MCMS, and copies of the finished product will be added to the park’s library as well as disseminated to other appropriate areas. A PDF copy will also be made available through the IRMA database for wider access.
Project milestones include review of previous Administrative History, interviews with current JODA staff, identifying former JODA staff to interview and pertinent oral history questions to ask, gathering of archival data, and the synthesis of the final report. The historian will have monthly meetings with the JODA site supervisor to evaluate progress.

The Great Basin Institute will recruit and support an Administrative Historian who will complete a new administrative history for John Day Fossil Beds National Monument (JODA). The historian at JODA will engage in researching and writing a comprehensive history of how JODA has been managed from 1996 to the present day, including important issues in planning, land acquisition, development, public relations, and other topics of ongoing management concern. The final narrative reference will consist of a scholarly examination of the administrative history of the unit and will serve as a valuable tool for future park managers and scholars. The research effort resulting from this project will significantly expand the site’s reference and archival files and provide additional information for park staff. Finally, the administrative history will be placed on JODA’s website to make the information widely available to the public.
A chronology of land acquisitions, paleontology research, archaeology surveys, park developments, special programs, resource protection and mitigation, and personnel changes are necessary to conduct many aspects of everyday park operations as well as in preparation for the Park’s 50-year anniversary in 2025. There has been a high degree of turnover at the Park recently. As such, there has been a great deal of loss of institutional memory. Having a new administrative history will help capture institutional knowledge and prevent further loss. The historian will create a published scholarly, and comprehensively updated report bridging the gap between the last administrative history report, in 1996, and the present. This report will be a substantial aid in the documentation of the history of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.
Description:
The updated administrative history will include photos and graphics as well as a comprehensive assessment of primary and secondary sources in local, regional, state and national archives.  Oral history interviews will be conducted with present and former NPS staff, park partners, volunteers and others. These interviews will require travel to meet individuals both within the commuting distance of the park and outside of it.

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Southwest Research Station (PSWRS). This project is based at three long-term ecohydrological research sites (Soaproot, Newt Creek, and Providence), which are managed by the PSWRS of the USDA FS in the Sierra Nevada.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: The participant will engage in field-based research examining the impacts of wildfire and drought-induced tree mortality on water quality and quantity in headwater forest ecosystems.

The participant will collect water and gas samples from boreholes, soils, and streams, with a focus on capturing spatiotemporal variation in hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to disturbance. Specific activities will include participating in field campaigns to monitor moisture dynamics, collecting and analyzing water samples for major ions, nutrients, water stable isotopes, and carbon isotopes, and assisting in the maintenance and calibration of field instrumentation.

Laboratory activities will involve preparing and analyzing samples using techniques such as ion chromatography and isotope ratio spectroscopy. The participant will collaborate closely with graduate students and project collaborators to synthesize results, compare site responses, and contribute to research on how forest structure and climate extremes shape water availability and watershed function.

Learning Objectives: This opportunity will provide training in hydrologic instrumentation, sample analysis, and environmental data interpretation, supporting the agency’s mission to advance science-based forest and water resource management.

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is David Dralle (david.dralle@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for 3 months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $16,251.10 monthly.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Questions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email ORISE.USFS.PSWRS@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.

Qualifications
The qualified candidate should be a faculty member at a US institution and returning to the University at the completion of the appointment.

Emergency Response – APHIS is an emergency response agency. This means that all Agency employees may be asked or assigned to participate in rotating temporary duty assignments to support emergency programs at some time during their careers with APHIS. It is difficult to predict the frequency with which such emergency situations may occur – and could range from several emergencies in a year to none over the course of many years. In the event that you are called upon tosupport an emergency program, this may require irregular working hours, including overtime, and may include duties other than those specified in your official position description. While some emergency program support assignments may be able to be performed at the employee’s current duty station, in other cases employees may be asked to go on-site to a temporary duty state location. In addition, it may be necessary for employees to participate in multiple rotations to an emergency program assignment. Attempts will be made to keep disruption to the employee to a minimum.

Come join a growing team of conservation professionals at the Xerces Society who are dedicated to protecting some of the world’s most important animals. We are seeking a skilled and collaborative expert in invertebrate conservation, who has an interest in helping federal Farm Bill conservation programs work for monarch butterfly, pollinator, and beneficial invertebrate conservation in Texas. The ideal candidate should have direct experience working with the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, and be knowledgeable of Farm Bill conservation programs, such as EQIP, CSP, CRP and ACEP. The ideal candidate will also have a strong background in the conservation of monarch butterflies, pollinators in general, or other important invertebrate species, including those that serve as food for wildlife or that help in pest control. 

At Xerces, we harness the knowledge of scientists and the enthusiasm of the public to implement conservation programs. We take action by helping farmers, ranchers, and public agencies develop conservation plans for pollinators and beneficial insects, producing ground-breaking publications on invertebrate conservation, training thousands of farmers, ranchers and land managers to protect and manage habitat for beneficial insects, protecting endangered species and their habitat, and engaging the public to raise awareness about valuable invertebrates.

Description
At RES, we’re looking for purpose-driven individuals who are passionate about restoration and sustainability, and who want their work to make a lasting environmental impact. Our team members go above and beyond, bringing initiative, integrity, and a strong work ethic to every project. Collaboration is key—we thrive on teamwork, open communication, and diverse perspectives. In a field that constantly changes, we value those who are resilient, adaptable, and resourceful in the face of challenges. If you're intellectually curious, eager to learn, and ready to help restore ecosystems and protect natural resources, you’ll find your place here.

RES is looking for a Scientist IV to join our team.

As a Scientist IV at RES, you’ll serve as a senior technical expert, project team leader, and mentor to early-career scientists. You will manage interdisciplinary field teams, conduct advanced scientific analysis, and ensure that data collection and reporting meet rigorous technical, regulatory, and quality standards. You will play a critical role in interpreting ecological data, guiding project strategy, and delivering high-value outcomes for clients across restoration, mitigation, and compliance efforts. 

This position is based in our Fort Lauderdale, FL office, and the selected candidate is expected to work from the office via a hybrid schedule. Some travel and overnight stays are anticipated. Approximately 60-70% of your time will be spent in the field, supporting projects across South and Central Florida.

Why You’ll Love This Job

You’ll be the go-to technical expert. Your insights and leadership will shape project decisions, mentor rising talent, and support ecological outcomes across regions.
You’ll lead meaningful science. Whether it’s analyzing wetlands, monitoring threatened species, or designing sampling protocols, your work will directly impact restoration success.
You’ll have variety and influence. One day might involve designing a functional assessment approach; the next, presenting scientific findings to a client or regulatory agency.
You’ll help grow people and projects. As a senior scientist, you’ll mentor junior team members, guide their growth, and shape technical strategy at every project phase.
 

A Day in the Life


Your day might begin by leading a morning field briefing for a multi-disciplinary team conducting a compliance visit at a restoration site. You’ll ensure protocols are followed, calibrate equipment, and troubleshoot field challenges. Back in the office, you might review QA/QC on monitoring data from another region, advise on permitting language, or refine a risk assessment for an upcoming project.

As a senior team member, you may be reviewing reports for scientific accuracy, contributing to the technical content of proposals, or collaborating with clients to develop site-specific assessment strategies. You are also actively mentoring junior scientists, answering fieldwork questions, or guiding them through advanced ecological methods or regional permitting nuances.

 We would like to talk to you if you have many of the following:

Bachelor’s degree in environmental science, biology, ecology, geology, or a related field
10+ years of scientific experience, or 8+ years with an advanced degree
Strong project leadership skills, including field planning, workload management, and scientific coordination
Client-facing experience with technical proposal development and scientific presentation
Deep experience with scientific data collection, QA/QC, analysis, and reporting
Advanced knowledge in at least one and broad knowledge across several ecological or environmental scientific disciplines
Proficiency in GIS tools, scientific software, and data visualization
Experience collaborating with regulatory agencies, interpreting SOPs, and applying permitting framework
You will thrive in this position if you: 

Enjoy leading and training multidisciplinary field teams in dynamic environments
Take pride in mentoring junior staff and fostering technical growth in others
Excel at building strong client relationships and thinking strategically about project delivery
What would make you stand out?

Master’s degree or PhD in a relevant discipline
Certifications such as PWS, CWB, CERP, PG, or specialized state or federal licenses
Publication in scientific journals or leadership in professional organizations

Shoreline sampling of mussels may occur along rocky and muddy shorelines at night in remote areas. The incumbent may lift heavy objects such as ice-filled coolers and baskets of fish on the deck of a moving boat. Fish handled by staff may possess sharp and venomous spines and may bite. The incumbent will assist with deploying and retrieving sampling nets from a boat or shore. This position may involve working in or near water, including tasks that require navigating, negotiating, and performing duties related to water environments.

Lab: Work will involve sitting or standing at a lab bench while performing repetitive, sometimes tedious dissections of fish and invertebrates for long periods of time. Dissections and sample creation may occur in a mobile laboratory set up on a boat or an off-site location but mostly will occur at the NRB Marine Resources Lab. The incumbent may also haul frozen samples in and out of a walk-in freezer and may handle chemicals including formalin, alcohol, and various acids. Use of sharp instruments such as scalpels, knives, and syringes is required.

Schedule: Standard business hours are Monday – Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., but the incumbent may be expected to adjust the work schedule to meet field sampling requirements.  A flexible work schedule will be considered at the incumbent’s request, subject to supervisory approval.

Travel: Travel is required at infrequent intervals to attend meetings or to conduct fieldwork.  This work requires driving long distances throughout western Washington, sometimes at night.  During field surveys, the incumbent may spend up to 5 days away from home on a boat or in motels.

Tools and equipment: Duties require the use of lab equipment (e.g., scalpels, syringes, meat grinders), field gear (PFDs, waders, botts, raingear) and field equipment (e.g., small boats and outboard motors, beach seines, lampara seines, etc.)

This means that all Agency employees may be asked or assigned to participate in rotating temporary duty assignments to support emergency programs at some time during their careers with APHIS.
