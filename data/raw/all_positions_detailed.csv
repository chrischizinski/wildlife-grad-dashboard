Description
The Bernhardt lab in the Department of Biology at Duke University and the Lowman lab in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington (UW) are jointly recruiting a PhD student in aquatic ecology to start in fall 2026. We are keen to identify a self-motivated and creative student who is interested in contributing to our research focused on how aquatic bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, hornworts) support stream ecosystem function (organic matter storage, nutrient cycling) and freshwater biodiversity. The position is fully funded through a combination of grant funding from the National Science Foundation and relevant teaching/research assistantships, including a paid stipend, tuition waiver, and health insurance.
 The graduate student will join a dynamic and highly collaborative team of freshwater scientists studying how changing climate, hydrology, and human activities alter aquatic ecosystem function and connections with the surrounding landscape. The position will involve participating in fieldwork in New Hampshire, processing samples using various analytical procedures, managing research teams, mentoring undergraduate students, maintaining and analyzing data, writing scientific manuscripts, serving as a teaching assistant, and contributing to the broader lab communities. The student will be expected to work closely with collaborators at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies and the U.S. Forest Service at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. Students will have the opportunity to take advantage of a rich array of hydrologic, biogeochemical, and ecological data that have been collected at Hubbard Brook since the 1950s and will be encouraged to develop dissertations that best align with their stated goals and interests. They may also develop collaborations among associated programs (Duke University Program in Ecology, UW’sQuantitative Ecology and Resource Management Program) and research groups (Duke River Center, UW’sFreshwater Initiative).
 Successful candidates will be: enthusiastic about aquatic ecology; organized and detail-oriented with demonstrated experience managing research projects; and collegial and excited to collaborate as part of multi-disciplinary research groups. Applicants must possess a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field (biology, chemistry, earth/environmental science, etc.) by spring 2026 and a minimum of one year of prior research experience (either in academic or professional settings). There is also a possibility for the student to begin work on the project as a field research technician in summer 2026.
 Interested applicants should submit a one-page cover letter (describing past experience, motivation to pursue a graduate degree, and interest in this position), a CV or resume, an unofficial transcript, and contact information for three references via e-mail to both Emily Bernhardt (emily.bernhardt@duke.edu) and Heili Lowman (heili.lowman@duke.edu) by October 15. We are jointly committed to building equitable, supportive research communities and strongly encourage applications from candidates with a diversity of experiences, interests, and identities. Applicants whose skills and interests best align with the research team will be invited to conduct interviews in late October. Competitive applicants will be invited to apply to the location(s) of their choosing. The student may choose to apply/matriculate at either Duke University in Durham, NC or the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. Neither graduate program requires applicants to have taken the GRE. Please reach out to either Emily or Heili with any questions regarding applications, graduate programs, lab groups, or research projects.

Description
I am looking for a new doctoral student in my Aquatic Ecology lab for Fall 2026 (North Miami, FL). I am looking for an independent thinker who is honest, hard-working and motivated to study population or community ecology in aquatic ecosystems, specifically in wetlands. The PhD project may involve use of long-term data collected on federal and state-funded projects.  Dissertation topics are partly at the discretion of the student, but some aspect should involve population ecology, invasive fish ecology crayfish population ecology, or trophic interactions of aquatic animals or wading birds in the context of wetland environmental variation (droughts, floods, nutrients, invasive species).  The immediate context of our work is the Everglades wetlands of southern Florida. 
 The position will be supported each year with a combination of research and teaching assistantship (annual stipend of $30,625 plus a tuition waiver and health benefits) with opportunities to apply for fellowships in later years.   It may be possible that the position could start earlier in the summer (May-June) as a technician before matriculation. 
    Qualifications: 
The positions require a bachelor’s degree in biology plus extensive research experience or a completed MS degree in a related field.  A demonstrated strong work ethic and the ability to conduct field work and data analyses will both be important. The student will become part of a large lab (students, postdocs and technicians) and therefore having the ability to both work in a team and independently will be required. Previous scientific writing experience is important. An MS degree and prior research experience with ecology and/or work in wetlands are desirable.  Minimum academic qualifications include an undergraduate GPA > 3.0 three letters of recommendation. A GRE is helpful, but not required. A valid driver's license is required.  
 Interested students should send their materials to Dr. Nathan Dorn (ndorn@fiu.edu) before officially applying to the PhD program at FIU (https://case.fiu.edu/biology/phd-in-biology/admissions/index.html).  
 Please send a cover letter explaining your research interest, background/suitability and your career goals, and what about my lab is a good fit for your research interest.  Also send a resume or CV (including any degrees/scores) and contact information for 3 professional references (professors, supervisors or employers) before December 4, 2025. Review of applications (by Dr. Dorn) will begin in mid-November. Applicants of minority status and underserved groups are encouraged to apply.

Description
 Overview 
We are seeking a student to undertake doctoral research investigating the role of predator management and environmental variables on braided river bird conservation in Canterbury, Aotearoa | New Zealand.  The project will work with the Ashley Rakahuri Recovery Group, a community conservation organisation that undertakes bird surveys and predator control on the river. We anticipate a project that builds on the strong work of this group to answer questions related to understanding the optimal interventions that community groups can take to increase populations of endemic braided river birds. There is some scope for the student to develop their own research questions within this broader research focus. 
 The student will be be enrolled in Te Kura Pūtaiao Koiora |The School of Biological Sciences at Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury (UC) in Christchurch. Tenure is for three years, and is entirely research-focused, with no required coursework. The scholarship provides a tax-free stipend of $32,650 per year and also covers all tuition fees, for three years. 
 Project Background 
Braided rivers in New Zealand are breeding sites for a range of endemic birds, some of which are declining. The Ashley River/Rakahuri is a smaller braided river which has several rare or declining species (including black fronted tern and wrybill). It is close to Christchurch, and has a community group ARRG (Ashley Rakahuri Recovery Group) which has been doing pest control and nest monitoring since 2004. However, while the trapping effort has increased, bird nest success on the Ashley has declined. 
 The overall aim is to determine the most successful interventions for the conservation of braided river birds in the Ashley River/Rakahuri. 
Research questions that could be addressed by this PhD include: 
What are the key factors determining nest success in selected bird species (including flooding, riverbed island dynamics, weed control, exotic mammalian predators, and native bird predators)?
How effectively can numbers of key pests be reduced (trap types, numbers and locations, use of dogs etc)?
Is the balance of predator species changing and is that affected by pest control?
What is the most effective method for nest monitoring?
How important is reproduction (relative to adult survival) in bird population trends?


The exact focus of the PhD would depend on the skills and interests of the selected student who will work with our supervisory team and ARRG representatives to develop research objectives that best complement the student’s interests, previous experiences, and aspirations.

Who you are

We are looking for a confident, independent, capable, and motivated student with a strong interest in avian conservation. We seek someone curious, enthusiastic, and eager to contribute to innovative research. You should be able to engage productively with external parties - such as community groups - and have strong communication skills. You should have experience working independently in the field, ideally with experience monitoring birds and/or with vertebrate pest control. A good grounding in ecological statistics is highly desirable. Additional skills, such as GIS, mist-netting, nest monitoring, and/or handling of wild birds would be advantageous but are not essential.

These characteristics will be demonstrated by your previous research experience, training, interests and other activities, and underpinned by either a Masters degree or a Bachelors degree with Honours (a 4-year degree with a senior thesis may satisfy this), in ecology or a related field. The ideal candidate will have had some research experience (demonstrated by associated outputs like a publication or thesis). We particularly welcome applications from individuals from under-represented groups.

A valid New Zealand driver’s license and ability to drive safely in New Zealand conditions (a mix of urban and country roads) will be required.

Applicants must meet the eligibility requirements of the University of Canterbury, and must be available to begin study by March 2026.

To apply, please provide:

1. A cover letter that outlines your motivation, interests and experience.

2. A curriculum vitae and copies of your academic transcripts (unofficial copies are fine at this stage).

3. Contact information for two referees able to comment on your academic and other achievements.

Applications should be emailed as a single pdf file with your name in the file name to Sara Kross (sara.kross@canterbury.ac.nz) with “PhD Scholarship on braided river birds” in the subject line. The position is open until filled, but we recommend submitting applications by 15 October for full consideration. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions.

Background: The Mamoozadeh Lab at North Carolina State University (NC State) is accepting applications for an MSc student to begin January 2026 (spring semester). The Mamoozadeh Lab leverages genomics and bioinformatics to explore questions related to the applied conservation and management of fish species. This research is conducted in close collaboration with state and federal fisheries management agencies. Students work in lab and field environments, and build transferable skills in creativity, leadership, and communication, as well as highly marketable skills in field biology, genetics/genomics, and bioinformatics. The Mamoozadeh Lab is housed within the Department of Applied Ecology at NC State, which also houses the USGS Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center and the USGS North Carolina Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, offering abundant opportunities for integrative and applied research in fisheries contexts. The selected applicant will work directly with Dr. Nadya Mamoozadeh on the NC State campus located in Raleigh, North Carolina.
 Project Description: The successful applicant will complete the MSc degree program requirements while leading genomics research aimed at characterizing outcomes of targeted restoration activities for brook trout in the southern Appalachians (eastern Tennessee and Great Smoky Mountains National Park). This will involve tasks in:
Coordinating the collection and curation of brook trout samples and corresponding metadata
Isolation and quantitation of DNA from tissues
Preparation of reduced representation libraries for high-throughput sequencing 
Analysis of sequence data to produce genotypes and assess population genetic relationships
Writing of thesis chapters and associated manuscripts for peer-reviewed publication
Sharing research findings with funders and other relevant stakeholders
 Qualifications: Applicants should have a BSc degree in the field of biology, ecology, fisheries, natural resources, genetics/genomics, bioinformatics, or a related field. Preference will be given to candidates with prior molecular lab experience (especially library preparation for high-throughput sequencing) and with quantitative skills that include analyzing genomic datasets (such as in R and related bioinformatic pipelines). Competitive candidates will also have strong communication and leadership skills, as well as the ability to work independently. We are a very interactive lab and are looking for an enthusiastic scientist who cares about fisheries conservation and management. We are also a lab that celebrates diversity and inclusivity, and we warmly invite lab members to contribute to this culture.
 Support: Students in the Mamoozadeh Lab receive a stipend, tuition, and health insurance, as well as support for professional travel. This support may come through a mix of teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and other sources.
 How to Apply: Interested students should email the following to Dr. Nadya Mamoozadeh (nrmamooz@ncsu.edu) as a single PDF and using the subject line “Brook Trout Genomics Student”:

Graduate Opportunities
Description
The Hileman Population Ecology and Wildlife Management lab seeks a highly motivated student with an interest in population ecology, wildlife management, and herpetology. Recent work by Clark et al. (2025, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2501745122) found evidence of inbreeding and inbreeding depression in two eastern massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus) rattlesnake populations in southwestern Michigan. The successful applicant will build upon this work and conduct research related to the following objectives: 

1) Estimate the extent of inbreeding at a neighboring disjunct population using the genomic methods of Clark et al. (2025). This information will be used to evaluate if restoring connectivity between these two historically connected populations is warranted and is likely to increase the probability of persistence. 

2) Identify a suitable location for installation of a wildlife underpass to restore connectivity and gene flow between two historically connected eastern massasauga populations using radio telemetry and GIS methods. 

3) Evaluate the efficacy of ongoing habitat restoration using detection/non-detection data in a Before-After-Control-Impact design. 

Start Date: Spring 2026 
 
Qualifications 
The successful application will possess demonstrated excellent written and oral communication skills, be self-motivated, and able to work both independently and as part of a team. Candidates must have a B.S. or B.A. degree from an accredited university and a valid driver’s license by 1 January 2026. Although not a requirement, preference will be given to applicants with a background in spatial ecology, biostatistics, and/or genetics, and familiarity with R programming language and GIS. Previous field experience working in adverse weather conditions, especially with salamanders, is also beneficial. The successful applicant will be expected to produce high quality research, present their work at professional conferences, and publish their findings in peer-reviewed journals. 
 
Salary / Benefits 
This graduate teaching assistantship includes two and half years of support, health insurance, and tuition waiver. 
 
How to apply 
Please submit a single PDF to Dr. Eric Hileman (eric.hileman@mail.wvu.edu) that includes the following: 1) cover letter, 2) curriculum vitae, 3) transcripts (unofficial), 4) GRE scores (this requirement may be waived), and 5) complete contact information for three professional references.

Description
A Master of Science (MSc) position is available at Auburn University (start date: January 2026). The student will be hosted by the Aquatic Reproductive Physiology lab (P.I. Dr. Ian A.E. Butts) and the Auburn University Shellfish Lab (P.I. Dr. Andrea Tarnecki). In terms of research, our long-term objectives are to address needs identified by the Alabama shellfish aquaculture industry and its stakeholders by testing technology/practices that have the potential to alleviate challenges and bottlenecks encountered by the oyster farming industry. To accomplish this, we take an interdisciplinary approach to test hypotheses in applied aquaculture and hatchery science.

Responsibilities and tasks
To improve oyster production numbers and best allocate available resources, oyster hatchery efforts should prioritize fertilizing eggs with high-quality sperm. Sperm of high quality have increased fertilization, hatch rates, and survival to set. Research on the relationship between sperm parameters and larval success, as well as factors (i.e., genetic, environmental, dietary) that influence sperm quality is lacking for oysters in general, particularly using cryopreserved sperm. To that end, the purpose of this MS project is to identify biomarkers for sperm quality (both fresh and frozen) to improve the efficiency of oyster hatcheries.
 Qualifications
We are looking for a motivated candidate who has:
·  Bachelor’s degree in biology or a similar degree
·  Knowledge of aquaculture and aquatic physiology  
·  Proven ability to carry out goal-oriented work and fluent with data management systems (i.e. Excel, Word, statistical analysis)
·  Lab competences in physiology would be considered an asset - please clarify your experiences in the “motivating letter”
·  Practical husbandry experiences with aquatic organisms will be an asset
·  Good co-operation ability
·  Must have a valid U.S. government issued driver’s license and a satisfactory driving record.

 Approval and Enrollment
This graduate appointment is subject to academic approval, and the candidate will be enrolled in the MSc program within the School of Fisheries, Aquaculture and Aquatic Sciences (SFAAS). For information about our program please see:  http://sfaas.auburn.edu/programs-of-study/graduate-studies/
 Salary and appointment terms
The MSc ($22,500 + benefits for 2 years) salary and appointment terms are consistent with the current rules for graduate students. Typically, a tuition waiver is provided. The students will begin coursework and research in January 2026. This 2 year project will be carried out at the Auburn University Shellfish Lab, which is situated in Dauphin Island, Alabama (https://agriculture.auburn.edu/research/faas/auburn-shellfish-lab/).

The successful candidate will be expected to develop a nationally recognized, externally funded research
program that is collaborative, interdisciplinary, and self-sustaining. The program should address critical
challenges related to the sustainability, health, productivity, and marketability of forested landscapes in
Texas and beyond. The position will offer opportunities to work closely with faculty and researchers
across the Texas A&M University System, including AgriLife Research, AgriLife Extension, and the
Texas A&M Forest Service. This is a unique opportunity to contribute to applied forest science in a
region facing significant ecological and economic shifts, and to support the development of resilient
forest landscapes through cutting-edge research in forest ecology and modeling.
Forests in Texas are abundant, diverse, and ecologically significant, covering approximately 35% of the
state’s land area. According to the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, Texas contains an
estimated 60 million acres of forestland, with nearly 48 million acres of non-commercial forests located in
central and west Texas. Most of these forestlands, approximately 93%, are privately owned, with the
remainder managed by state agencies, national forests, and other public entities.
Texas forests play a critical role in supporting the environmental, economic, and social well-being of
communities across the state, while also contributing to broader national and global ecological functions.
However, forests in central and west Texas face a unique set of management challenges, including
climate variability, parcelization, invasive species, and limited commercial markets. Given their
importance and vulnerability, it is essential to advance our scientific understanding of these forest systems
to guide sound management decisions that enhance forest health, promote sustainable stewardship, and
conserve vital soil, water, and wildlife resources across the state.
The successful candidate will be responsible for planning, implementing, and conducting fundamental

including atmospheric emissions and soil health metrics.

• Leverage and contribute to data, models, and algorithms sourced from government, academic,
and industry partners, including collaboration with other Blackland/Grassland research teams and
their national and international networks. The candidate is expected to develop and improve
simulation models, secure extramural funding, train graduate students, and actively disseminate
findings.

• Publish research results in peer-reviewed journals and technical reports and share models and
tools with relevant stakeholders, land managers, and the broader scientific community.

• Engage with forest industry professionals, community service providers, and entrepreneurs, and
participate in outreach activities to ensure research relevance and applicability to stakeholders.

• Collaborate with the Texas A&M Forest Service, Texas Forestry Association, county Extension
agents, statewide faculty, and other forestry professionals to support applied research and
outreach that addresses regional needs.

• Contribute to programming efforts that yield tangible, measurable impacts on the economic and

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Southwest Research Station (PSWRS) located in Hilo, Hawaii.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: The Hawaii Permanent Plot Network, known as HIPPNET (www.hippnet.hawaii.edu), is a long-term ecosystem and climate monitoring project, conducting vegetation remeasurements every 5 years for monitoring ecosystem plots on Hawaii Island's windward (wet) and leeward (dry) sides. The HIPPNET forest monitoring plots are part of the Smithsonian Institution’s global forest monitoring network known as the Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO, https://forestgeo.si.edu/). The standardized protocols utilized in the HIPPNET project were developed by the Smithsonian’s Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) and are the same as those used by the ForestGEO sites around the world. The HIPPNET plots provide a natural outdoor classroom for hands-on training in these global forest monitoring field techniques utilized in ForestGEO and the computer software and hardware technology currently being used.

The participants will be mentored as part of a larger field team to learn the field protocols for the vegetation measurements within the 2 permanent forest plots of HIPPNET. Field research in the 4 hectare forest plots will involve collecting information for every tree that is greater than 1 cm diameter in size and specifically will involve tree identification, tagging and marking new trees, mapping new trees into the geo-referenced database, collecting tree diameter data, collecting growth habit data, and estimating abundance of herbaceous vegetation. The 2 HIPPNET sites are within different forest types thus providing experience in both tropical wet and dry forests and the opportunity to learn the vegetation communities of these two forest types on Hawaii Island.

Participants will also gain experience in the quality assurance and quality control protocols used by HIPPNET in the field and with the larger dataset.

Description
The Department of Biology in the College of Science, at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) (http://www.uta.edu/biology/), invites applications for a Tenure-Track faculty position in Bioinformatics at the rank of Assistant or Associate Professor. We seek to expand our strengths in computational and experimental biology to incorporate ground-breaking research in Bioinformatics that leverages modern machine learning and AI approaches.

We invite applications from researchers working at the interface of data science and biology, with particular interest in those leveraging AI and large-scale datasets to investigate fundamental questions in the life sciences. Priority will be given to candidates whose work uses computational and data-driven approaches to explore complex biological systems or processes by integrating across multiple levels of organization, from molecules and gene networks to organisms, populations, and ecosystems. We are also interested in research that integrates diverse data types, such as genomic, phenotypic, environmental, or ecological data, to uncover patterns, mechanisms, and emergent properties underlying biological function, health, disease, and/or ecosystem dynamics. Candidates whose work bridges disciplines and pushes the boundaries of how large-scale data and AI can be used to advance biological understanding are strongly encouraged to apply.

Successful candidates will have a doctoral degree in a relevant field and should demonstrate strong promise for acquiring extramural grant funding and potential for producing high quality research and scholarly or creative achievements that advance the field; and show strong promise to develop and use novel biological, theoretical, and quantitative approaches as well as functional experimental methods to investigate complex biological systems such as the interaction of the environment with an individual’s genome and interactions among organisms.

New faculty will further contribute to the UTA community through high-quality teaching using evidence-based practices to engage undergraduate and graduate (Master's and Ph.D.) students from various backgrounds and experiences effectively.

Start-up funds, salaries, and teaching loads are highly competitive, and successful candidates will have opportunities to apply for generous state funds with which the University and Department has had considerable success. 
 This position is expected to start September 1, 2026.

Purpose:

Stewards Individual Placements (Stewards), a program of Conservation Legacy, provides individuals with AmeriCorps service and career opportunities to strengthen communities and preserve our natural resources. Participants serve with federal agencies, tribal governments, and nonprofits to provide institutional capacity, develop community relationships, and support ecosystem health. Stewards in partnership with Grand Teton National Park will host an Ecological Assistant.

This Ecological Assistant is an AmeriCorps position that will apply and expand upon current data analysis and visualization techniques using R for both long-term ecosystem health monitoring and habitat restoration monitoring in sagebrush ecosystems in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
This individual placement provides an opportunity to engage in a breadth of survey, monitoring, and mapping techniques for a range of management needs across a range of ecosystems. The individual placement will perform ecological monitoring, surveying and mapping for various programs and projects in the branch of Vegetation Ecology and Management at Grand Teton National Park. Monitoring ranges from qualitative (e.g. site observation and photo points) to quantitative data collection (e.g., recording plant species abundance in plots) and long-term trend monitoring to short-term efficacy monitoring. Examples include long-term sagebrush and high elevation plant communities; sagebrush restoration; grazing utilization; whitebark pine direct seeding germination and survivorship; sagebrush restoration planting success; revegetation success, invasive plant management outcomes, rare plant surveys, invasive plant surveys, and disturbance mapping. The duties will be a combination of field data collection and office-based field prep, data management, data summary, and analysis.

·        Coursework in statistical modeling techniques and general programming. 
·        The individual will have some experience in writing scientific reports and science outreach products. 
·        Strengths should also include the ability to work independently, and problem solve. 
·        Then incumbent should be self-motivated and curious about plant community ecology, sagebrush ecosystems and ecological restoration and factors that drive plant community dynamics.
 Additional Position and Community Information
·        Grand Teton National Park covers 310,000 acres in western Wyoming. The park showcases iconic peaks, but also protects high quality sagebrush steppe valley, high alpine wildflower meadows, and riparian corridors which support some of the most fantastic wildlife habitat in North America. You will live at approximately 6,500 feet elevation, with the Grand Teton reaching 13,000 ft. The town of Jackson is about 20 minutes away, and while busy, hosts a great deal of services.

The recreational opportunities are boundless, as the crew can often be found camping, floating the river, hiking, fishing, mountain biking, backpacking, and enjoying live music in town.
·        It is important to have a personal vehicle. Town and grocery stores are 20+ minute drive from housing, along a highway with temperatures and wind discouraging biking.
