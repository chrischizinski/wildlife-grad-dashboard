Description
Mountain ecosystems are among the regions most susceptible to temperature warming, and species adapted to alpine ecosystems are predicted to face local extinctions via physiological and/or behavioral intolerance to rapid increases in temperature. Persistence of alpine avifauna will depend upon the ability of individuals to seek out microhabitats that provide cool refugia while engaging in behaviors that reduce energy expenditure. Identifying such microclimate refugia and understanding how alpine birds use them will help inform management strategies for conserving alpine ecosystems in the face of rapid temperature warming. This funded PhD project focuses on two focal species, Rock Ptarmigan and Rock Partridge, using state-of-the-art GPS tracking technology to quantify fine-scale movement patterns, as well as climate monitoring at study sites and land surface temperature mapping using a thermal drone. The project is located in the Swiss Alps and has completed two field seasons, with fieldwork projected to continue for an additional 1-2 years. 

The successful PhD Candidate will have access to the full study data set, with the opportunity to develop new field and/or analytical components depending upon logistics, expertise and interest. The Candidate must hold a MSc degree in biology or equivalent and ideally will show a strong interest in conservation science, environmental management and spatial analyses. 

Additional preferred (but not required) skills include: field experience studying birds or other vertebrates in montane landscapes, strong quantitative background with ability and interest to rapidly gain new skillsets related to the joint analysis of animal movement, climate, and remote sensing data, and knowledge of French and/or German. 

The project will be co-advised as a collaboration between Prof. Dr. Raphaël Arlettaz at University of Bern Division of Conservation Biology (Switzerland) and Assistant Professor Dr. Ian Ausprey at Texas A&M University Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology (USA). The Candidate will spend the first year at Uni Bern and the second two years at Texas A&M University and must be willing and able to commit to this schedule (exact timing negotiable). The PhD will be defended and granted at Uni Bern. 

Start: January 2026. Duration: 3 years, with possible prolongation. Salary according to SNSF rules. 

Applications must be submitted to ian.ausprey@ag.tamu.edu and should include a motivation letter describing your interests, experience and relevance for this position, a CV (including a list of publications if available), abstract of MSc thesis, and contact information for three professional references (institution, email, and phone number).

The application deadline is September 7th, 2025, with online interviews during the second half of September 2025.

Description
 Graduate Assistantship (M.S.), Grassland Plant Ecology 
 I am seeking a highly motivated individual to join a collaborative team studying the role of a dominant grazer in replanted, native grasslands.  The project utilizes sites that are part of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)—one of the largest grassland restoration initiatives in the U.S.  For example in Kansas, the CRP program has re-established approximately 1 million acres of native grassland; however, most of these sites do not include a dominant grazer despite the critical role that bison historically played in these systems.  Our project tests whether strategic cattle-grazing can enhance the conservation benefits to native plant communities and bird habitat in short and tallgrass prairie regions (Colorado and Kansas).  Two specific project objectives for this graduate position are to 1) quantify how grazers influence plant structural heterogeneity in ways that may improve habitat for wildlife and 2) examine how grazers influence the re-establishment of native plants.  
 This M.S. position requires someone who is self-motivated, works well with a team of field researchers, and has a strong interest in ecology.  The project will involve extensive fieldwork in Kansas and Colorado particularly during the summers.  Some knowledge of grassland plants is preferred, but strong students with the aptitude to learn plants quickly will also be considered.  Because we will be collaborating with private landowners, experience working in the United States is required as well as proficiency in spoken and written English.  Applicants should have an undergraduate degree in ecology, biology, or a related field and must meet the requirements for admission at Wichita State University.  Successful applicants will receive a 2-year assistantship with an annual stipend of $25,000 along with a tuition waiver and health benefits. This position begins January 2026.   To apply, email your CV, a transcript, and a letter describing your research interests and future goals to Dr. Greg Houseman (greg.houseman@wichita.edu).  An unofficial transcript will suffice for the initial application with an official copy needed if accepted into the program.  You do not need to apply to the Graduate School until you have been accepted into my lab.  Review of applications will begin Sept 15, 2025 and will continue until the positions is filled.  Please contact me if you have any questions! 
 Wichita State University is a research-intensive university set in an urban area (~540,000 people including surrounding suburbs) yet close to numerous high quality grasslands including the iconic Flint Hills region. Wichita offers many opportunities for cultural/artistic activities and low cost-of-living.

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Forest Service Northern Research Station (NRS) located in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Grand Rapids is a small, rural community in north-central Minnesota. The Forestry Sciences Laboratory is located on the University of Minnesota North Central Research and Outreach Center adjacent to the Minnesota North Community College - Itasca Campus. 

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: The chemistry laboratory in the Grand Rapids Forestry Sciences Laboratory supports studies of forest and resource management. The office is part of the Research and Development program of the Northern Research Station (NRS) of the USDA Forest Service. The primary opportunity of the fellows will be to participate in the preparation of samples for chemical analysis and learn a range of skills associated with a chemistry laboratory. Samples may be soils, sediments, plant tissues, or water collected from studies. In addition to research of NRS scientists, the laboratory supports analysis for the NRS Forest Inventory and Analysis Program, the Air Resource Monitoring Program, other cooperating federal agencies, and academic partners. The opportunity will include cataloging and organization of incoming samples, processing and preparing samples for analysis and entering of data produced during analysis. Fellows will collaborate with the laboratory manager (chemist), a physical sciences technician, and other staff associated with mentoring by a hydrologist/project leader (supervisor of all staff within the local research unit).

Learning Objectives: Fellows arriving with more advanced skills and experience with chemical analysis may be provided the opportunity to learn about instrument calibration, operation, and data quality control/quality assurance procedures, or operate analytical instruments for the measurement for basic inorganic solutes/constituents and nutrients. The fellow/s will be exposed to both research and research operations support, which are both germane to gaining insight of routine stages of many different science support positions within research institutions, whether in a federal government research agency, academia, or the commercial sector. 

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Stephen Sebestyen (stephen.sebestyen@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: September 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is part time. The opportunity is in the range of 10 to 20 hours per week, with flexible hours within period between 6:30 AM to 4:30 PM, weekdays only, typically during the academic year (fall and spring semesters only).  A fellow is expected to reliably complete the agreed upon total hours per month (based upon 10-20 hr per week).

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $680 per month, but contingent on participation level.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.

We value a wide range of professional and lived experiences, and people of underrepresented communities are strongly encouraged to apply.  

Our Vision  

The vision of the Oregon Water Resources Department is to assure sufficient and sustainable water supplies are available to meet current and future needs. 

Our Mission

The Department's mission is to serve the public by practicing and promoting responsible water management through two key goals:

To directly address Oregon's water supply needs
To restore and protect streamflows and watersheds in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of Oregon's ecosystems, economy, and quality of life

Core Values 
 Integrity – We are accountable for all that we do. We act with honesty and promote transparency.  
Service – We are dedicated to providing outstanding service and treating everyone equitably in our management and stewardship of state resources.  
Technical Excellence – We base our resource decisions on law, science, and expertise.  
Teamwork – We are united in our mission, relying on one another and working together with the communities we serve.  
Forward-Looking – We seek innovative and practical solutions to the water challenges of today and tomorrow.  

2019-2024 Strategic Plan

The Oregon Water Resources Department’s strategic priorities for 2019-2024 are to:  
Modernize our management of Oregon’s surface water and groundwater resources to meet instream and out-of-stream uses  
Work to secure Oregon’s instream and out-of-stream water future in the face of increasing water scarcity  
Foster a forward-looking team dedicated to serving Oregonians with integrity and excellence.  

About our Team 

The Planning, Collaboration, and Investments (PCI) Division builds partnerships and incentivizes Oregonians to pursue integrated and innovative solutions for complex water challenges and an uncertain water future.

About the Position 

As a Senior Water Advisor, you will lead Department efforts in pursuit of solutions to complex water management challenges in coordination with other Department staff and various interests (i.e., tribes, stakeholder groups, communities, state/federal agencies, the public, etc.). This position will focus on complex water issues in Eastern Oregon and may work on priority issues in other areas of the state. You will be a critical and valued member of the Planning, Collaboration, and Investments Division.

As water scarcity and uncertainty increase, the State of Oregon must work with partners to find ways to address complex water management challenges and meet both instream and out of steam needs. As an agency expert in negotiating a path forward on water solutions, you will:

Develop recommendations, pursue water management solutions, negotiate on behalf of the agency, and manage projects on highly contentious or complicated aspects of water management in the assigned basin(s).
Formulate and execute work plans for basin or agency priority project(s) and basins in a way that is transparent, inclusive, and professional and ensures strong coordination across agency sections and with external partners.
Collaborate with tribes, state/federal agencies, various stakeholder interests, and the public and use conflict resolution techniques to make meaningful progress on various projects that help achieve the agency’s mission.
Be a basin-focused project lead and representative for WRD, creating trust and relationships with local resources while ensuring that proposed solutions are in line with Oregon Water Law, the Department Strategic Plan and Integrated Water Resources Strategy.
Coordinate with other Divisions and Sections within the Department to meet project goals, timelines and maintain effective lines of communication.
Engage with and build trust and relationships with those who live, work, or have an interest in the areas of the state in which you work.

While some emergency program support assignments may be able to be performed at the employee’s current duty station, in other cases employees may be asked to go on-site to a temporary duty state location.  In addition, it may be necessary for employees to participate in multiple rotations to an emergency program assignment.  Attempts will be made to keep disruption to the employee to a minimum.

With sustainability and conservation in mind, these positions will provide WDFW with the information needed to estimate harvest and the impacts of sport fisheries to ESA Listed species and other species.

These are opportunities to conduct sport fishery monitoring in the Tri-cities area during the fall salmon fishery and assists with stream surveys in the Hanford Reach/Yakima River.

We are seeking candidates to be responsible for estimating effort, catch, harvest, and origin of salmon and steelhead during summer and fall fisheries from the Highway 395 Bridge (Pasco) upstream to Priest Rapids Dam.
 

WHAT TO EXPECT
Among the varied range of responsibilities held within this role, this position will:

Field Data Collection.
Sport Fishery Surveys: Collect detailed information from anglers participating in salmon/steelhead sport fisheries during on-site interviews at area boat launches and shoreline fishing access areas. Determine effort through boat trailer index counts and interviews. Identify harvest to species and collect biological information from the harvest including number, length, gender, fin clips, coded wire tags, PIT tags, and collect scales for aging.
Stream Surveys: Collect post spawn salmon carcasses in-river by boat and along shorelines within the WDFW District 4 waters of the Columbia and Yakima Rivers. Sampling protocols will follow sport fishery methods with the addition of otolith collection (aging and origin) and spawn success (egg retention). Females will be dissected to determine spawn success. All carcasses will be cut in half post sampling to avoid duplicate sampling.
Ensure all biological samples are collected following field sampling protocols defined by their supervisor(s). All salmon will be scanned for the presence of coded wire tags. Any fish with a coded wire tag present will be sampled following standard protocols and the snout will be removed and transported to the WDFW District office for processing.

Travel (daily).
Tow, launch, and operate State boats ranging from 18’ to 20” in length.
Maintain records including operator, date, boat number, gallons, costs, and collect and file all fuel receipts.

Data review and entry.
Review all data collected in the field and upon returning to the office for completeness and accuracy.
Properly collect, package, label, and process all biological samples at the end of each shift.

Vehicle and Boat Maintenance.
Ensures that all equipment, boats, and vehicles are fueled, cleaned, sanitized, and maintained daily.
Check vehicles and boats daily for routine maintenance (oil, tires, lights), oil and pump lubrication (boats), and notify supervisor of any mechanical problems as soon as they are observed.

Working Conditions:

Work setting: Work is conducted primarily in the field and will require travel to multiple public access sites and remote locations including work on-river in the Hanford Reach area of the Columbia River and the lower 30 miles of the Yakima River.  Field work will be conducted during inclement weather.   Hiking over rough and slippery terrain.   Individual may work with chemicals for biological sampling (ethanol) and vehicle operations (gasoline and oil).  Responsible for use and care of vehicles, boats, equipment, PIT tag readers, and CWT wands.  Stationed alone at public fishing areas for up to 10 hours per day to conduct creel sampling.  Many locations are primitive without facilities or quick availability to medical facilities.  Majority of the work will be near the Hanford Department of Energy site.  This position may involve working in or near water, including tasks that require navigating, negotiating, and performing duties related to water environments.

Schedule: Position is fulltime and may occasionally require work over 40 hours per week. Scheduled days and hours of work will vary and will require work on weekends and potentially on holidays.

Travel requirements: Routinely travel to public and primitive access sites along the Columbia and lower Yakima Rivers. State vehicle will be provided. Stream surveys will require travel and routinely working from boats in the Columbia River.

Customer Interactions: daily interactions with anglers and the public during creel surveys. Technician will be collecting angler information on fishing times, locations, catch, and harvest in addition to biologically sampling all fish from each boat/angler.
