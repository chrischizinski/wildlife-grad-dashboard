Description
A graduate assistantship is available at the Ph.D. or M.S. level to study the role of weather patterns on migratory songbird flight behaviors, especially during trans-Gulf crossings, using barometric pressure data loggers.

The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

The mission of our research is to improve food safety and reduce foodborne illness by examining routes of contamination of fruits and vegetables with bacterial pathogens.

Research Project: The participant will examine issues related to irrigation water quality and sustainability. Specifically, the fellow will research to examine specific pre-harvest environments that support bacterial pathogen (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica) survival under a variety of conditions that are not optimal growth conditions. The survival data of pathogens under these conditions (growth matrices + sub-optimal growth temperatures + antimicrobial stresses) will also be used to assess transfer of pathogen loads to fruits and vegetables. The microbial community changes and its influence on pathogen levels will also be quantified. These data will fit into models that could predict the likelihood of contamination with certain environmental conditions. 

Under guidance of the mentor the participant will design and be a part off all aspects of the experiment, from laboratory to growth chambers to fields, in consultation with ARS and academic collaborators. This growth and survival assays, combinations of growth / survival conditions, methodology and protocols, along with digital PCR, multiplex PCR, and microbial community analysis required. Participant will also learn about statistical analysis of data in consultation with ARS colleagues. Participant will be a part of field studies and cultivation and growth of plants/ fruits, and filter construction and maintenance as related to the research project. Participant will learn about scientific and laboratory setup and organization of these studies. 

Learning Objectives: The participant will learn methods to quantify and / or determine the prevalence of bacterial pathogen loads in irrigation water, novel filter design concepts, integrated data collection and analysis methods. The participant will have the opportunity to learn more in-depth statistical analysis techniques or molecular biology tools (bioinformatics) through various trainings and workshops if desired, and also through collaboration on interdisciplinary project within ARS. This is an integrated produce safety research project, and the participant will have opportunities to learn at each stage of the continuum.

Description
The Gilbert Quantitative Wildlife Ecology Lab at Oklahoma State University is recruiting a MS student to study Mountain Plovers, starting in January 2026.

 The Mountain Plover is a shorebird of the shortgrass prairie of the western Great Plains and is listed as Near Threatened due to long-term population declines and habitat loss. Western Oklahoma is near the southeast margin of the species’ breeding population; surveys in the 1990’s and early 2000’s documented a small breeding population. However, there have been no follow-up monitoring programs, and thus the current distribution and population size of Mountain Plovers in Oklahoma is unknown. The MS student will lead fieldwork to survey Mountain Plovers during the breeding season (April-June) for two years. 
 The student will be supported by a research assistantship during the spring semester and summer months and a teaching assistantship in the Department of Biology during the fall semesters. Teaching assignments may include teaching ecology or introductory biology labs and typically consist of 2 labs per semester. 
 The Gilbert Lab conducts a variety of quantitative wildlife research, with previous research projects focused on large-scale patterns in wildlife behavior and community structure as well as developing methods for complex ecological data. For more information about the lab and the PI Dr. Gilbert, please visit: https://www.gilbertecology.com/ 
 Oklahoma State University is in Stillwater, OK, which has been described as America’s friendliest college town. And this doesn’t seem to be a marketing gimmick by the chamber of commerce – it is a small town where newcomers are welcome and where it is easy to make friends! Cost-of-living is low such that one can live comfortably on a graduate stipend. The state is an interesting place to be a biologist given the diversity of ecoregions. 
  Desired qualifications 
Excellent writing and communication skills 
BS in biology, ecology, wildlife, or related field 
Experience with conducting field work under challenging conditions
Background with statistics/data science and GIS
Experience with avian fieldwork/research
 To apply, email a CV (~2-3 pages; include contact information for 3 references) and cover letter (~1 page) describing your interest in the position and qualifications to Dr. Neil Gilbert (neil.gilbert@okstate.edu) with the subject line “Mountain Plover MS position”. Application deadline is September 5th and review of applications will begin immediately.

Description
The Division of Forestry and Natural Resources at West Virginia University is searching for a Ph.D. and Masters student to monitor Ruffed Grouse populations, in response to different landscape contexts and disturbances, including varying levels of timber harvests, prescribed fire, and cut-back borders. The students will use Autonomous Recording Units (ARUs) and spring drumming counts to determine occupancy and abundance of Ruffed Grouse. The students will also be responsible for sampling mosquitoes for West Nile Virus. Finally, the students will collect data about other breeding birds utilizing young forests, and vegetation structure data.

This project will occur across West Virginia on private and public lands. Ruffed Grouse and bird utilizing young forests have declined precipitously, and the goal of this project is to identify landscape scale management strategies to improve populations via occupancy or abundance. Additionally, West Nile Virus could be a contributing factor in Ruffed Grouse declines, and in West Virginia there are no data about the distribution and prevalence of the virus or mosquitoes. The students will also have opportunities and flexibility to develop and design additional research projects if they are within the scope of the main project questions. Some songbird species that could respond to management include Golden-winged warbler, Prairie warbler, and Yellow-breasted chat. 

The project will occur on multiple state wildlife management areas, state forests, and on Weyerhaeuser property. There will be significant traveling and potential for camping or living in rustic state field houses. The students should also have experience driving on gravel or dirt roads and with 4x4 vehicles. The data collection will begin in April and continue into August. Students should expect to be flexible with scheduling and work together to coordinate data collection schedules. Results should inform landscape level planning and management strategies for Ruffed Grouse and other young forest species. The research is funded through the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources, Ruffed Grouse Society, and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. 

The students will be working towards a Ph.D. and master’s in Wildlife and Fisheries Resources at West Virginia University. STARTING DATE: January 2026. The ideal applicant should have experience with ARUs and analyzing acoustic data, must be able to identify central Appalachian avian species by sight and by sound and have experience conducting point count surveys, and some experience with insect sampling and mosquito identification. Applicants should also be familiar with collecting structural habitat measurements including but not limited to; DBH, canopy cover (using spherical densitometers), Robel pole, Daubenmire frame, etc. Applicants should be comfortable working long days in the field during hot summer months, ready to travel, and energetic and excited about applied avian conservation research. Applicants will also be responsible for hiring and supervising research technicians to assist with research duties. Applicants must have completed a BS for the master’s program and BS and MS in for the PhD program in Wildlife Biology, Ecology, or a closely related field. Applicants with peer-reviewed publications are preferred. Applicants for the PhD position must have a minimum of 300 combined GRE score (V+Q) or 1100 on the previous scale, and a minimum 3.25 GPA. To Apply: Electronic applications are preferred. To apply send a single file including: 1) a cover letter outlining any relevant work experiences with Ruffed Grouse, ARUs and acoustic monitoring, avian point counts, mosquito/invertebrate sampling and identification, 2) resumé including an unofficial copy of transcripts and GRE scores, and 3) contact information for 3 references to Dr. Chris Lituma; cml0017@mail.wvu.edu

Ph.D. position on multispecies use of habitat managed for Kirtland’s Warbler 
The Tonra Lab of Avian Ecology and the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center are searching for a qualified student to lead a Ph.D. research project of regional conservation importance in the School of Environment and Natural Resources at The Ohio State University. The position will preferably begin in January of 2026, but alternative start dates may be possible. 

Project Description: 
The project will study patterns of occupancy and abundance of Kirtland’s Warbler, Common Nighthawk, Eastern Whip-poor-will, Spruce Grouse, and Ruffed Grouse on sites managed for the warbler. To determine how occupancy and abundance vary with site- and landscape-level factors, we will integrate acoustic data collected via autonomous recording units and vegetation surveys from across the Kirtland’s Warbler breeding range with remote sensing data to build models that predict habitat characteristics that optimize abundance across species. Our research will produce recommendations on how best to manage and create habitat within Kirtland’s Warbler Management Areas and will also highlight where to prioritize restoration projects - all with the goal of creating optimal Kirtland’s Warbler habitat while maximizing avian species richness and recreation (i.e., hunting) opportunity. 
The Ph.D. student will be supported on a combination of Graduate Research Assistantships and Graduate Teaching Assistantships for the duration of the degree (5 years). The position includes a tuition waiver and monthly stipend (currently $2,848/month). Travel during fieldwork and other associated research costs will also be funded. 
 Required Qualifications: 
Candidates for this position must possess a minimum of a Bachelor of Science degree (Master of Science strongly preferred) in Wildlife, Biology, Zoology, or a related field. Furthermore, they must have an academic transcript commensurate with acceptance to the graduate program in Fisheries and Wildlife in the School of Environment and Natural Resources (https://senr.osu.edu/graduate/admissions). 
This project will generate a large amount of data for analysis, thus in addition to prior field work experience, we are seeking a student with excellent quantitative skills and experience with GIS. Therefore, the successful candidate will have experience working with Program R, ArcGIS or other GIS software, multiple years of experience in field ecology, the ability and willingness to work long hours independently in the field, and a valid drivers license. 
 Preferred Qualifications: 
Additional desirable qualifications include experience in programming languages in addition to R , experience working with autonomous recording units (ARUs) and associated data, experience conducting vegetation surveys, and bird identification skills. 
  To apply: 
Email a 1-page cover letter outlining your interest in and qualifications for the position, C.V., unofficial academic transcript, and contact information for 3 references to Chris Tonra (tonra.1@osu.edu).  Applications will be considered as they are received until the position is filled.

Description
Life Net Nature Ecuador Bird Monitoring Expedition A Cost-share Volunteer Training Experience

Learn or improve bird banding and monitoring skills in the tropical Andes mountains of western Ecuador. Help advance science about tropical montane forest bird communities. Learn how to collect data to determine community and species-level responses to deforestation, forest recovery, forest fragmentation, and landscape and climate changes. Your participation helps sustain an important protected area in the mega-diverse Choco Endemic Bird Area (EBA). 

Cost-share volunteers/trainees assist Dr. Dusti Becker with long-term avian monitoring and conservation in the Andes at the beautiful forest protected area, Reserva las Tangaras.  In exchange volunteers receive experience-based training in mist netting and bird banding, including the use of Hall traps and practice with hummingbird banding. 

Team Dates:      August 9-22, 2026 (8 positions available)

                             December 7-20, 2026 (8 positions available)

Where:  Reserva Las Tangaras, a 130-acre nature preserve, boasts more than 25 species of hummingbirds, dozens of colorful tanagers, the largest regional Andean cock-of-the-rock display lek, along with over 300 tropical bird species, many of which are Choco and Andean endemics. During the expedition, LNN teams typically detect around 175 - 200 different species of birds in the reserve and study area. Team members always see additional bird species while traveling to and from the project site. The reserve is also home to endangered capuchin monkeys, spectacled bears, cougars, and myriads of other wildlife species, including several rare and endangered rain frogs. 

Activities: Volunteers are trained (or refreshed on) setting up and monitoring mist nets, extracting birds from nets, carrying birds from nets to banding stations, and recording ornithological and ecological data in the field. Volunteers are also trained to band birds and make standard measurements of birds. Volunteers also learn about Hall trapping and banding hummingbirds. The site is rugged, requiring above average fitness including: ability to hike on steep, potentially muddy and slippery terrain, and cover 2-4 miles on foot per day. Back or joint impairments, or obesity may make the project too challenging for some. 

Volunteers will have time to explore the Mindo area, and the team visits higher-elevation Bellavista Cloud Forest Reserve on the last day before returning to Quito. The December team will participate in the Mindo Christmas Bird Count (CBC), which typically wins first or second place globally for bird species counted. 

Food and Lodging: Accommodation is in a spacious research cabin, where each participant has a single bed mattress with mosquito netting, pillow, and fitted sheet. Two showers with hot water and flush toilets provide comfortable field accommodations. Meals are delicious, home-style Ecuadorian, prepared by excellent cooks, and vegetarian diets can be accommodated. 

COST: Your contribution of $2250 covers transportation during the field project to and from Quito,Ecuador, meals at RLT, lodging at RLT, reserve entrance fees, salaries for Ecuadorian cooks and para-biologists, leader's costs, and a special lunch at the Bellavista Reserve. Airfare to and from Quito, Ecuador and expenses in Quito before and after the expedition are not included. Meals away from RLT during project are not included. 

Your cost-share helps sustain Reserva las Tangaras, supporting year-round stewardship, educational programs, outreach materials about cloud forest wildlife, maintenance of trails and signs, cabin repairs, and feeding of resident hummingbirds. Cost-share donations are used to operate the 2-week field expedition: providing the team with food, shelter, training and transportation, as well as purchasing new project equipment and supplies. 

This exciting conservation expedition begins and ends in Quito, Ecuador. 

Contact Dr. Dusti Becker, dustizuni@yahoo.com, for further details and to obtain a Life Net Nature volunteer application form. 

Qualifications: Experience with banding and mist-netting are desirable, but not required. We provide training. Students and recent graduates will benefit from this great resume building experience. Professionals and retirees in field biology, will enjoy the ""field camp"" experience and are much appreciated for their co-mentoring and experiences they share. All participants have the option of using the > 20 year project database for research publications, undergraduate projects, or graduate degrees.

Representatives from Tribes/First Nations composed one-third of NABS participation, and 25% of participants were from the agricultural sector. The second NABS is planned for Fall 2026 in line with the 10th anniversary of passage of the National Bison Legacy Act. 
 The NABS Team designs and develops the Summit to draw together diverse sectors to examine and aptly characterize the American Bison as contributing to the preservation of rural life in North America while engaging the livestock community in efforts to find common values and collaborate. Outcomes planned are: 
 1.     Models & Methodologies with best practices for bison conservation in harmony with ranching. 
2.    Collaboration at landscape unit, cross-sector, and multi-jurisdictional scales. 
3.    Recognized benefits of wild and managed grazers for ecological restoration and climate resilience. 
4.    Buffalo culture revitalization and food sovereignty by Tribal/First Nations. 
 5.    Bison disease mitigation, genetic variability, and whole herd health. 
6.    Ecological, cultural and economic valuation woven into conservation and management goals. 
7.    An uplifting of the U.S. National Mammal and historical meaning of the bison to Canada and Mexico and Tribal/First Nations, generating new partnerships.

Description
 Grassland loss is the greatest conservation issue facing eastern North American biodiversity. Our precious Southeastern grasslands are nearly extinct, and the species that depend on them are fading fast. Many of our Southeastern grasslands that managed to persist through the past 200 years have disappeared in the past quarter-century. What will the next 25 years bring? As a conservation community, we are only now beginning to realize the extent of our once widespread grasslands. To reverse the decline in grassland biodiversity, our response must be rapid and unprecedented in magnitude. This immensely complex and ambitious challenge will require some of America's brightest and most creative minds in conservation and philanthropy to solve. Are you ready to join the Southeastern Grasslands Institute’s team? 
 Austin Peay State University’s Southeastern Grasslands Institute (SGI) invites applications for a full-time, non-tenure-track position as Chief Strategy Officer (CSO). Reporting directly to the Executive Director, the CSO leads the design, execution, and evaluation of strategic initiatives, ensuring alignment with the organization's long-term goals and conservation outcomes. This role requires a visionary strategist and connector, a great listener, a strong communicator, and an experienced program leader capable of translating conservation science and policy into scalable action within the growing network of SGI’s senior leadership team and its nationwide network of partners and funders. This position may be located at SGI headquarters in Clarksville, TN, or remotely in the following states: AL, AR, FL, KY, LA, NC, OK, TX. 
 Primary Duties and Responsibilities 
●       Lead the development and execution of multi-year strategic initiatives that advance the organization’s mission and national conservation priorities. 
●       Identify emerging opportunities, risks, and innovations in the conservation landscape and guide the organization’s strategic response. 
●       Serve as a trusted advisor to the Executive Director and senior leadership team on organizational direction and external positioning. 
●       Oversee the implementation and coordination of complex, cross-cutting partnership networks (e.g., SGI’s work with the America’s Grasslands Coalition and Volgenau Climate Initiative) and across programs (science and restoration, landscape conservation, mapping and planning, community engagement, tribal relations). 
●       Coordinate internal resources and external partnerships to ensure effective execution, impact measurement, and reporting. 
●       Ensure initiatives remain on schedule, within scope, and aligned with organizational values and ecological goals. 
●       Build and maintain strategic relationships with key stakeholders, including governments, NGOs, funders, Indigenous and local communities, and private-sector allies. 
●       Represent the organization at high-level events, coalitions, and policy forums to advance strategic initiatives and partnerships. 
●       Working with the Director of Philanthropy and the Executive Director, support fundraising efforts by identifying funding opportunities, opportunities for sustainable financing, cultivating donor relationships, and contributing to grant proposals. 
●       Promote a culture of innovation, collaboration, and results-based management within the organization.

Our projects encompass a diverse range of studies, including giraffe population monitoring, bird habitat research, vegetation and plant studies, as well as documentation of wildflowers, butterflies, and other insects. We aim to uncover and showcase the reserve’s rich and largely understudied biodiversity.

The Role: 
This internship offers a valuable opportunity to contribute to meaningful conservation efforts through marketing, while gaining hands-on experience in wildlife research. As an intern, your responsibilities will include:

Explore and document the diverse species—including insects, wildflowers, and plants—across the reserve.
Work in an environment teeming with untouched natural beauty and incredible wildlife.
Gain hands-on research experience in a largely understudied region with enormous potential.  

What We’re Looking For:  
A student or recent graduate in Social Media Marketing, Digital Marketing, or a related field.
Passion for wildlife, storytelling, and making a positive impact.
Creative and proactive approach to managing and growing social media platforms.
Experience with photography, videography, or graphic design is a plus.  

Please note that a monthly conservation fee is required, which covers the following:
Conservation Fees: As you’ll be staying on a wildlife reserve, a portion of your fee will go towards supporting the protection and care of the land and the species that inhabit it.

   Comfortable accommodation will be provided during your stay.

Transportation: Pick-up from and drop-off at the Polokwane airport, weekly or bi-weekly town trips for students to restock supplies, and daily drives around the reserve.

This fee ensures that your experience contributes to both your well-being and the vital work of preserving the reserve.

Duration of Stay:  
Flexible | We recommend a commitment of 2 to 4 months to fully immerse yourself in the experience.

Application Details:  
Submit your resume and a brief cover letter to info@bushveldbiodiversity.org

Description
Note to interested applicants about minimum qualifications for this position: Previous experience as a wildlife biologist is required to meet the minimum qualifications. Graduate education alone does not meet the minimum qualifications for the Wildlife Biologist 3 position. Wildlife technician experience is not equivalent to wildlife biologist experience. Minimum qualifications are listed in the job announcement linked above. 

What you will be doing:
In this Wildlife Biologist 3 position, the incumbent will work collaboratively as part of the research team in Region IV of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to evaluate critical management and ecological questions in large game mammals, with a focus on large carnivores, including wolves and brown bears. The incumbent will be responsible for working with wildlife managers to identify research questions and associated hypotheses and will lead development and execution of rigorous studies to evaluate those hypotheses, assist other researchers in project development and execution, and lead or contribute to development of new or evaluation of existing survey and inventory techniques. The incumbent will be responsible for contributing or leading all aspects of the study from beginning to end, including study design, logistics, data analysis, research presentations at professional meetings, writing of interim reports and final publications, and communicating the findings with wildlife managers, the Board of Game, the public, and other audiences.

Our organization, mission, and culture: 
Under the Alaska Constitution and Alaska Statutes, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game is responsible for managing fish and wildlife species for the benefit of all people consistent with the sustained yield principle. Much of our work focuses on research to inform conservation and management of large game species in an effort to support subsistence and recreational harvest opportunities. This includes the preferential harvest of ungulates consistent with these laws.  

Benefits of joining our team: 
The incumbent will have opportunities to support science-based management and address applied and novel ecological questions with a focus on large carnivores. In collaboration with other research staff, the incumbent will have opportunities to contribute to research aimed at understanding topics such as apparent competition, denning ecology, nutritional ecology, movement ecology, population ecology, predator-prey interactions, and more. In addition to contributing to ongoing projects and developing new projects, the incumbent also will have opportunities to work on existing data spanning several decades. The incumbent will be joining a team with expertise in stable isotopes, physiology and nutrition, and biometrics. Publication is encouraged and expected of all members of the team and will be collaborative.

The working conditions you can expect:
The incumbent will conduct field work in remote parts of southcentral and southwestern Alaska, in some of the most scenic areas in the world. Field work can occur in all weather conditions and may require flying in small fixed-wing aircraft for many hours at a time or capturing animals via darting from a helicopter. Work from small boats and via ATVs or snowmachines also may be required to meet needs of specific projects. Some work may include extended stays in remote field camps to conduct vegetation sampling or other fieldwork. Incumbents will be exposed to biting insects, snow, wind, rain, continuous sun, and other hazardous conditions during fieldwork. Incumbents will be required to be certified to carry firearms and bear spray during field work. The incumbent will have a private office in Palmer to conduct analyses, writing, and other office work.
Requires frequent travel for fieldwork (at least 10 days at a time at least twice a year)

Who we are looking for:
We are looking for a candidate who possesses some or all of the skills listed below.
Experience developing and executing research projects from beginning to end, including development of research questions and hypotheses, study design, execution of data collection in remote field conditions or otherwise, data analysis, writing, and publishing in reputable, peer-reviewed journals.
Experience analyzing animal location and movement data, such as for analyses of home ranges, habitat use and selection, migration analyses, range fidelity, etc. and/or experience collecting and analyzing population abundance and demographic data, including conducting aerial surveys and estimating abundance and population parameters and growth rates using techniques such as mark-resight, capture-mark-recapture, sightability, and integrated population models.
Experience researching and publishing on predator-prey interactions or apparent competition.
Experience analyzing large, complex datasets in R or other statistical software.
Experience managing logistics for complex fieldwork in remote settings.

Description
 The Wildlife Restoration Foundation (WRF) “I Am Bear Safe” (IABS) Project Coordinator for Yellowstone-Tetons Country is open to qualified individuals passionate about bears and based in/near the five countries that neighbor the east and west sides of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks in Wyoming and Idaho. The position is initially unpaid, but stipends are available to cover pre-approved expenses and to reward accomplishments after a productive first month. The Yellowstone-Tetons Country IABS Project Coordinator will rapidly gain valuable professional experience and connections by playing an exciting, integral leadership role on the WRF team. Work to build WRF’s bear conservation capacity and impact on Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park bears as you contribute and strengthen your conservation knowledge and skills. Gain recognition for your efforts among area partners, on the WRF website and elsewhere, as you participate visibly in meeting WRF’s mission, which is to increase park wildlife population viability both ex situ and in situ, working closely with National Parks and Forests, state wildlife and tourism agencies, Tribes, zoo partners, and park gateway communities. 

 

WRF operates effectively and efficiently and generates resources that enable measurable, boots-on-the-ground conservation results. Under the direction and guidance of the WRF President and Beary Program Director, the WRF IABS Project Coordinator for Yellowstone-Tetons Country (YTC) will focus on IABS Project implementation in towns like Dubois and Lander, Wyoming and Driggs, Victor and Island Park, Idaho that are park gateway communities frequented by bears. The YTC IABS Project Coordinator will collaborate with the WRF President, Beary Program Director, other IABS Project Coordinators, Director of Communications, and other team members, as well as partnering parks, state agencies, chambers of commerce, tourism entities, and possibly Tribal and zoo partners in connection to the “I Am Bear Safe” Project. [https://www.wildlifeandparks.org/projects]. 

 

“I Am Bear Safe”™ (IABS) is a multi-partner WRF Collaborating with Wildlife Strategy designed to equip National Park gateway community chambers of commerce and their member businesses (“Park Gateway Partners”), to “train people not to train bears” to get in the trouble they are in now because of human behavior—a situation that is assuring bear demise. Bears are a top attraction at many National Parks and are well-managed within the parks to avoid human interaction. But communities at the park’s edge are not often sufficiently prepared or equipped for the increasing pressure of more visitors coupled with rapid development, naïve new residents, and a growing number of recreationists in bear country. Park Gateway Partner (PGP) businesses are the perfect intervention point and receive marketing benefits from participating in the IABS town-based bear stewardship effort. WRF provides customized tools (signage and SWAG) that equip PGPs to effectively intercept park visitors and recreationists and equip them to be bear stewards who act responsibly by securing attractants and following park and Tribal rules for recreating in bear habitat. The IABS goal is that bears perform their natural behaviors and survive without risk and distraction caused by humans while supporting the economic benefits to park gateway towns from responsible tourism and recreation.



Responsibilities:

·         Manage the IABS Project on the ground in the small towns that are gateways to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks and neighboring National Forests on the northwest side of the park.

·         Develop, implement, and regularly assess and re-strategize with the team on a plan of action that assures the maximum participation by IABS Park Gateway Partner businesses.

·         Maximize WRF’s opportunities as a member of the town chambers of commerce.

·         Work with the Beary Program Director to manage the IABS Toolkit (signage) inventory of items needed by and distributed to PGPs in each town.

·         Distribute IABS Toolkt materials to PGPs and redistribution points.

·         Recruit new PGPs, setting goals for the season.

·         Field questions and relay PGP concerns to WRF.

·         Attend meetings of the chamber of commerce or local partner organization and events on occasion.

·         Keep the IABS Project Management Database up to date for Yellowstone-Teton Country towns

·         Use creative ways to stimulate Bear Quiz-takers.

·         Come up with novel ideas to make the IABS Project more effective.

·         Possibly coordinate one or more IABS Bear Conservation Specialists/volunteer PGP recruiters.

 

Education & Experience
 Bachelor’s degree in relevant subject is required; graduate degree ideal.
Knowledge and experience specific to grizzly and black bears required.
Location in Montana, Wyoming or Idaho preferred.
Background working with federal and state agencies and chambers helpful.
Experience working with community-based organizations and/or local businesses required.
