Graduate Opportunities
Description
Indiana State University Department of Biology is seeking graduate applications (PhD preferred) from highly motivated and capable students to study water snake ecology (diamondback, copperbelly, and common water snakes). This position’s research will build off of a current MS water snake project at Indiana State University.
 A position fully supported by a teaching assistantship (2 years for MS, 5 years for PhD; $13,500 + tuition waiver) will be available starting January 2026. Additional summer assistantships may be available.
 There is opportunity for highly motivated and capable students to develop their own projects based on their interests and skills. Other current lab projects include comparing non-invasive monitoring methods, raccoon parasites, and analysis of stress hormones and ecological contaminants in bats and large carnivores. Graduate research projects can combine traditional field ecology studies with techniques and technology such as ecotoxicology, hormone analysis, GIS habitat analysis, mark-recapture, telemetry, and/or genetics/genomics.  Field-based data collection is typically conducted during the summer and laboratory work can be conducted throughout the year.  Fieldwork may involve canoeing/boating, mud, bugs, heat, handling animals, and other strenuous dirty-job type work (generally need to be able to lift ~50lbs).

Description
The Montana Master Naturalist Program is designed for people who want to stoke their curiosity, deepen their knowledge of the natural world, and give back to their communities in new ways. We hope that participants will not only build the skills to interpret Montana’s flora, fauna, and landscape, but that they will also gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the natural world, and therefore become better stewards of it. This program is an excellent certification for those looking to pursue a career in environmental education or interpretive guiding, or those just looking to enhance their connection to place. During six days of experiential, field-based education, participants learn to identify species, interpret behaviors, and affirm ecological relationships. This foundational, applied knowledge not only enriches a sense of place, but also builds the confidence, attention, and curiosity to respect and conserve diverse ecosystems.

Description
An MS assistantship is available starting Spring 2026 in the Department of Crop, Soil & Environmental Sciences at Auburn University. These positions are part of an interdisciplinary research project investigating wetland hydrology and biogeochemistry, focusing on innovative approaches to detect hydric soils in challenging environments. We seek highly motivated students to join our team, contributing to impactful research supporting wetland conservation and restoration under the USDA-NRCS Wetland Reserve Easement (WRE) program.

Project Rationale: Wetlands are critical ecosystems that regulate water quality, store carbon, and provide habitats for diverse species. However, detecting hydric soils—especially in smectitic soils—can be challenging due to a lack of traditional field indicators such as iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) oxides. This project seeks to address this gap by employing Indicators of Reduction in Soils (IRIS) devices, which monitor anaerobic conditions through Fe and Mn oxide coating removal. This research has significant implications for enhancing wetland identification and ensuring more accurate wetland restoration under the WRE program.

Project Objectives:

IRIS Film Implementation: Test the effectiveness of IRIS films in detecting anaerobic soil conditions in smectitic soils.
Soil Morphology and Biogeochemistry Linkages: Correlate IRIS results with changes in soil morphology, hydrology, and biogeochemical properties of problematic soils.
Field Evaluation of Rhizosphere Cameras: Compare field performance of IRIS rhizosphere cameras with standard IRIS film results.
Protocol Development: Utilize Mn coating removal data and time-of-saturation measurements to develop a tailored IRIS protocol for smectitic soils.

Minimum qualifications:

Bachelor's or Master's degree in Soil Science, Hydrology, Environmental Science, or a closely related field.
Strong writing and communication skills.
Proficiency in R or Python for data analysis and modeling.
A valid US driver’s license for field site visits.

Desired qualifications:

Background in wetland soils, biogeochemistry, and soil hydrology.
Experience with machine learning and image processing in R.
Strong statistical skills, including time series analysis.
Experience in hydrological modeling (e.g., Hydrus).
Additional expertise in digital soil mapping and soil morphology is a plus.
For questions, please email Dr. Thorsten Knappenberger (knappi@auburn.edu) or
Dr. Yaniv Olshansky (yzo0015@auburn.edu).

 *Applications may be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A postdoctoral research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment (NLAE), located in Ames, Iowa.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: The National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment (NLAE) generates information addressing critical problems in agriculture and watershed management to develop innovative solutions which increase the efficiency of agriculture systems and reduce environmental risk. Transdisciplinary teams address this through coordinated research in abiotic and biotic systems. The specific goal of this project is to develop a systems analysis model for an integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS) with system fertilization approach. ICLS are a sustainable intensification alternative to specialized commercial agroecosystems. Conserving the nutrients is key for agroecosystem success, and grazing animals play a crucial function to nutrient cycling and can positively affect subsequent crops yields when managed under moderate grazing intensities. Thus, a new approach of fertilization emerges—the system fertilization—which is based on the conceptual framework that fertilizer must be applied in the system phase that presents lower nutrient extraction and higher nutrient cycling capacity to optimize total system production. This approach will build on data and integrative modeling activities at NLAE. Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will have the opportunity to help develop a system-of-systems modeling approach that examines the interactions and feedbacks of cropping and livestock systems under two fertilization strategies (system fertilization or crop fertilization).

Learning Objectives: The fellow will have the following training opportunities:

Learn about the challenges in predicting dynamics of ICL agro-ecosystems while learning a range of computational skills needed to conduct these analyses at the system level.
Collaborate with multiple USDA ARS scientists and University partners on data analysis projects, and to write collaborative scientific papers dealing with aspects of ICLS across multiple spatial and temporal scales.
Learn AI technologies relevant to these problems and will develop and co-lead ARS-wide workshops resulting in a community of scientific practice with AI.
Develop a systems modeling approach using established Vensim toolkits.
Prepare reports for extension and/or scientific journal publication.
Apply their programming skills to real-world problems. 
Mentor(s): The mentors for this opportunity are Thanos Papanicolaou (Thanos.Papanicolaou@usda.gov) and Robert Malone (rob.malone@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds. 

Level of Participation: The appointment is full-time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) only.

Description
 ARS Office/Lab and Location: A postdoctoral research opportunity is available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Center for Grain and Animal Health Research and Arthropod-borne Animal Diseases Research Unit (ABADRU) in Manhattan, Kansas.  

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

The SCINet/Big Data Research Participation Program of the USDA ARS offers research opportunities to motivated postdoctoral fellows interested in solving agriculture-related problems at a range of spatial and temporal scales, from the genome to the continent, and sub-daily to evolutionary time scales. One of the goals of the SCINet Initiative is to develop and apply new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, to help solve complex agricultural problems that also depend on collaboration across scientific disciplines and geographic locations. In addition, many of these technologies rely on the synthesis, integration, and analysis of large, diverse datasets that benefit from high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. The objective of these fellowships is to facilitate cross-disciplinary, cross-location research through collaborative research on problems of interest to each applicant and amenable to or requiring the HPC environment. Training will be provided in data science, scientific computing, AI/machine learning, and related topics as needed for the fellow to complete their research. Additional funds are available for supplies and travel essential for the fellow's research.

Research Project: Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will research towards developing iterative forecasts for the spread of a viral arthropod-borne livestock disease from Mexico into the United States. Vesicular Stomatitis (VS) has a complex ecology with multiple vector species, host species, and a wide geographic range, occurring every year in southern Mexico and semi-periodically spreading northwards to cause outbreaks in the western US. We lack timely forecasts of direction and rate of disease spread during an outbreak event.  

Modeling approaches will feature process-based machine learning in high-performance computing (HPC) environments and include data assimilation techniques in a Bayesian framework. Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will identify and integrate multiple data streams into the model framework, including host and vector distributions, confirmed georeferenced reports of VS cases in the United States and Mexico, and publicly available environmental layers derived from satellites, observational networks, and reanalysis products.  

The forecasting model time lag will be paired with the time periods needed for impactful management activity (e.g., increased livestock monitoring, vector surveillance, animal movement and quarantines) at relevant spatial scales. The participant will collaboratively produce forecasts of VS disease emergence and spread meant to be updated iteratively over the outbreak season, with explicit quantification of forecast uncertainty. Findings from this project can be applied to other arthropod-borne disease systems. The participant will also have the opportunity to contribute open and reproducible high-performance computational workflows to the ARS SCINet and AI Center of Excellence (scinet.usda.gov) communities. 

Learning Objectives: The participant will learn about developing stakeholder-driven models of livestock disease spread that are widely applicable to a broad range of systems. The participant will also have the opportunity to take online courses and other trainings in coding (e.g., R, Python, HPC) and scientific topics, and to hone interdisciplinary communication, collaboration, and leadership skills through workshop and working group experiences.  

USDA-ARS Contact: If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact Dr. Amy Hudson at amy.hudson@usda.gov. 

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: Start date is flexible, anticipated in January 2026. 

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be renewed for a second year upon recommendation of the mentor and ARS. 

Level of Participation: The appointment is full-time. 

Participant Stipend: The participant(s) will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The current stipend range for this opportunity is $90,000 - $100,000/year plus a supplement to offset a health insurance premium. 

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR). 

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS.

Description
The Prince William Sound Science Center (PWSSC) in Cordova, Alaska, seeks an innovative, collaborative principal investigator to launch the organization’s program focused on coastal resilience.


About the Prince William Sound Science Center

The Prince William Sound Science Center (PWSSC) is an Alaska-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Incorporated in 1989 in the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, our mission is to advance community resilience and the understanding and sustainable use of ecosystems.

For over 36 years, PWSSC has been dedicated to providing tangible benefits to coastal communities through scientific research, ecosystem monitoring, applied science, inquiry-based STEAM education, and meaningful demonstration projects. PWSSC has boots on the ground, boats in the water, and students in the field year-round. Our work fosters community engagement, stewardship of natural resources, and lasting connections between people, science, and the environment while generating solutions to the challenges faced by marine and coastal communities and ecosystems.

Based in the remote and important commercial fishing community of Cordova, Alaska, our town is only accessible by boat or plane and is situated in the home of the world’s richest waters.


Context & Opportunity

PWSSC’s new coastal resilience program, led by the Director of Coastal Resilience (DCR), will guide the development and application of approaches that support a more resilient future for coastal communities. This opportunity comes at a pivotal time: coastal communities and industries are facing new challenges as the oceans they rely upon undergo change, and forward-looking solutions are needed to secure long-term stability and prosperity.

By advancing applied research, demonstration projects, and technology improvements—such as advanced fisheries management tools, maritime infrastructure modernization, renewable energy initiatives, full utilization of fisheries products, and development of value-added seafood—we can strengthen local economies while helping communities adapt. Additional opportunities include fishing fleet efficiency, fisheries processing improvements, cooperative research with industry, local foods programs, regenerative tourism, and support for emerging industries such as mariculture.

This work will be carried out with both ecosystem and economic benefits in mind, in partnership with internal staff and external collaborators. Public and private sectors alike are seeking practical strategies that support jobs, innovation, and community well-being, and our region—the northern Gulf of Alaska—offers one of the best opportunities to deliver solutions with relevance across Alaskan coastal communities and beyond.


Position Vision & Mission

Vision: Establish a new, world-class, applied science program in the home of the world’s richest waters.

Mission: Empower coastal communities to thrive through approaches that can be developed, tested, and used here and applied elsewhere.


Position Details

The Director of Coastal Resilience (DCR) will have a director-level research scientist designation. At PWSSC, each scientist leads an externally funded program of research and may oversee several team members, with opportunities to pursue research, educational outreach, and initiatives that align with our mission.

The DCR will develop an applied science program in one or more fields of expertise, increasing PWSSC’s mission impact and collaborating with partners across sectors. Through their work—and the work of others they may supervise or collaborate with—they will advance applied projects that empower coastal communities to thrive.

Examples of areas of interest include (but are not confined to):

Work with industry to bring new products, technology-driven solutions, or management approaches to fruition;
Build a comprehensive research program and identify strategic investments informed by the best available resilience science (social, environmental, economic);
Conduct investigations into renewable energy implementation options and how they may impact and benefit rural coastal community resilience;
Lead research on ecosystem management models that can be utilized at the state or federal level;
Provide insights into recent patterns of the North Pacific Ocean;
Help develop and advance regional economic development strategies, such as regenerative tourism;
Collaborate with scientists and fishermen on adaptation planning and implementation;
Establish a community engineering & entrepreneurship test bed, operating as an innovation workshop environment, startup accelerator, and prototype development hub;
Advance fisheries innovations in processing, management, or product development, such as by establishing a fisheries innovation focus area within the coastal resilience program.
The successful candidate will have a demonstrated history of collaboration with state/federal regulatory agencies, Tribes, industry, academia, and nonprofits, as well as a record of success in generating extramural funding from private, foundation, governmental, or other sources.

Applicants should have a strong working knowledge of coastal and ocean issues, stakeholders in Alaska, experience working on relevant projects or research in Alaska or elsewhere, the ability to become proficient in new topics, and excellent written and verbal communication skills.

Who You Are

You are a collaborative leader who thrives on bringing people together to solve complex challenges. You value both scientific rigor and community wisdom, and you know how to translate technical knowledge into practical solutions. You are entrepreneurial in spirit—creative, proactive, and resourceful in building partnerships and securing support. You are culturally responsive, with deep respect for Indigenous knowledge and the traditions of coastal communities.

You are a strong communicator, equally comfortable engaging with local residents, industry stakeholders, government officials, and academic researchers. You think strategically, balancing long-term vision with near-term results that make a difference. You adapt well to changing conditions, navigate uncertainty with resilience, and stay focused on solutions. Above all, you are passionate about advancing the prosperity, health, and sustainability of coastal communities and the ecosystems that support them.


Team & Work Environment

PWSSC is dedicated to advancing scientific knowledge about the ecosystems of the North Pacific and the resilience of Alaska’s coastal communities. Our research spans fisheries, climate change, ecosystem monitoring, avian ecology, mariculture, genetics, transcriptomics, ecotoxicology, oceanography, adaptation, and more.

Currently, the institution applies a 35% overhead rate to cover administrative and operational costs. To onboard this position, PWSSC will provide 100% salary + benefits support during the first year to help establish research activities. This support will taper off over the following two years to 67 % and 33%, respectively (possibly negotiable dependent on candidate’s funding success), with the expectation that the successful candidate will secure external funding to cover their salary and research program costs beyond the initial three-year period.

Our collaborative environment fosters innovative research, and our team enjoys access to research vessels, analytical and wet lab facilities, a running filtered seawater system, and extensive long-term datasets from our regional monitoring programs. We are committed to supporting groundbreaking research while providing an inclusive, supportive atmosphere and work-life balance for all team members.


Why Join Us?

Live in Cordova, a small, vibrant fishing community surrounded by the natural beauty of Prince William Sound and the Copper River Delta, with access to stunning outdoor activities year-round.
Contribute to self-directed, meaningful, cutting-edge research in a region recognized for its ecological significance.
Join a supportive and passionate team dedicated to helping coastal communities maintain socioeconomic resilience among healthy ecosystems.

Compensation & Benefits

Starting salary range: $90,000–$110,000 DOE. Job type: full time, exempt.

Salary level and startup funds are dependent on career level and may be negotiable. PWSSC is committed to supporting its principal investigators in building funded research portfolios that align with our mission.

Benefits include:

Medical/dental/vision insurance
10 paid holidays
Paid time off
403(b) retirement plan with employer match
Flexible spending account including dependent care option

Cooperative Extension Area IPM Advisor - Commensal Rodents and Urban Wildlife - Serving Santa Clara County and the San Francisco Bay Area (25-27)

University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources

Application Window

Open date: September 4, 2025

Next review date: Sunday, Nov 9, 2025 at 11:59pm (Pacific Time)
Apply by this date to ensure full consideration by the committee.

Final date: Monday, Feb 9, 2026 at 11:59pm (Pacific Time)
Applications will continue to be accepted until this date, but those received after the review date will only be considered if the position has not yet been filled.

Position description

The University of California, Agriculture and Natural Resources (UC ANR) invites applications for a UC Cooperative Extension (UCCE) Integrated Pest Management Advisor: Commensal Rodents and Urban Wildlife, serving Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Mateo/San Francisco Counties at the Assistant rank. The Advisor will develop an innovative multi-county applied research and extension education program that supports integrated management of commensal rodents and urban wildlife in the five-county area.

The Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Advisor will focus on research and education to effectively manage vertebrate pests in urban areas, with a special emphasis on commensal rodents such as rats and mice infesting areas in and around dwellings and other structures. Commensal rodents are considered ""pests of significant public health importance"" by the US EPA and are among the most important of all urban pests worldwide, with billions spent annually on damage to structures, infrastructure, and human health. Effective management of these pests protects both public health and the environment. The Area IPM Advisor will develop IPM strategies to manage these pests, working closely with public agencies, pest control operators, licensed pest management professionals, and other practitioners in the public health and pest control sectors.

UCCE Advisors are responsible for applied research and extension of knowledge. Research activities are applied, needs-based, and mission-oriented, focusing on addressing the challenges in our communities. Extension activities are the educational practices that Advisors use to share research results directly with clientele and communities to increase their knowledge and understanding of science-based research that supports and promotes the adoption of practices and technologies to solve problems. Extension methods may include individual consultations, presentations, organizing educational workshops and short courses, field demonstrations, and site visits. Information may also be disseminated via radio outreach, webinars, fact sheets, policy briefs, news blogs, and social media. Publications are expected in various formats, such as newsletters, articles for the popular press, curricula, conference proceedings, and peer-reviewed publications.

Successful research and extension programs result in new information that improves knowledge or understanding and adoption of new skills, practices, changed attitudes, policies, and improved environmental, health, economic, and/or social conditions. UCCE Advisors are evaluated through an academic advancement system based on four criteria: extending knowledge, applied research and creative activity, professional competence and activity, and university and public service.

Location Headquarters: The position will be headquartered at the University of California Cooperative Extension Office in Santa Clara County, located at 1553 Berger Drive, San Jose, California.

Position Details
Roof rats, Rattus rattus, have increased in range in recent years and are considered major pests in most of California's communities. Norway (or sewer) rats, Rattus norvegicus, are also very common, especially in inner cities with aging infrastructure and large communities of unhoused residents. Mice, including the house mouse, Mus musculus, and several native Peromyscus deer mice species (known to vector hantavirus), are also very common within California's dwellings and other structures. At the same time, formerly common tools for management have become more restricted. Urban uses of anticoagulant rodenticides have recently been restricted or removed (AB 1322, AB1788, AB2552) in California due to legitimate concerns about secondary poisoning of wildlife, disruptions to local food webs, and acute hazards to people and pets. There is a huge and growing need for the development of alternative strategies and evidence-based evaluation of best practices.

This advisor's research will focus on the development and evaluation of IPM programs to address high-priority vertebrate pests in and around structures, with emphasis on commensal rodents. Topics appropriate for research include:

• Alternatives to chemical tactics

• Best practices for existing chemical tactics

• Holistic IPM programs and advanced monitoring and trapping programs

• Evaluation and demonstration of new technologies, such as remote sensing and notification systems associated with physical traps

Success will be measured by increased use of IPM practices that improve the management of urban pests, address pests of public health significance, reduce unnecessary or unsafe pesticide use, and reduce pesticide exposure to natural ecosystems. Research results and knowledge are expected to be published in various UC ANR series and technical sheets, such as UC IPM's Pest Notes, trade journals, and peer-reviewed journals such as One Health, Pest Management Science, and Journal of Integrated Pest Management.

The Advisor will conduct extension activities, including coordinating with local public agencies, pest management professional groups, the UC IPM Program, and campus-based faculty and Cooperative Extension Specialists to develop, implement, and participate in train-the-trainer programs and hands-on workshops for urban pest management professionals. The Advisor will coordinate or participate in projects that demonstrate IPM practices to local audiences, either directly (for example, pest control operators) or indirectly (for example, through UC Master Gardeners).

Counties of Responsibility. This position has programmatic responsibilities in Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Mateo/San Francisco Counties. (San Mateo and San Francisco Counties are combined into one UC Cooperative Extension unit referred to as San Mateo/San Francisco).

Reporting Relationship: In this appointment, you will report directly to the UC Cooperative Extension Director for Santa Clara County and the UC IPM Statewide Director, with input from the UCCE directors in the other counties served. It is not a remote position; the candidate must be available to work onsite at the headquarters location in San Jose, CA, and travel to and be present in all five counties served. Specific expectations for maintaining office hours and fieldwork in the geographic area covered by this position will be outlined upon hire by the respective supervisors.

Qualifications and Skills Required

Education: A minimum of a master's degree in wildlife management, pest management, applied vertebrate ecology, or a closely related field is required at the time of appointment.

Key Qualifications

• The ability to address sensitive human-wildlife conflict situations both orally and in writing, as well as public policy conflict resolution, and the human dimensions of wildlife management

• Experience in wildlife management involving rodents or other animals that cause human-wildlife conflicts

• Experience in conducting applied, impact-oriented research on topics relevant to this position.

• Capacity or potential to accomplish team-based research and education programs consistent with the values of UCANR.

• Applicants need to meet appointment criteria for the respective University of California academic title series and evidence for success in meeting required academic advancement criteria as per UC Academic Personnel Manuals. Applications need to document relevant research, extension, teaching experience, and appropriate scholarly achievements.

• Ability and means to travel on a flexible schedule as needed. Proof of liability and property damage insurance on vehicle used is required. Must possess or obtain a valid California Driver's License to drive a county or university vehicle.

Additional Skills Required

• Interest in and desire to pursue a career in UC Cooperative Extension.

• Technical Competence and Impact: The candidate should understand key concepts to optimize engagement and development and be able to design and implement a program that leads to positive changes and impact within the community and beyond.

• Communication: Demonstrated excellence in written, oral, interpersonal, and information technology communication skills.

• Collaboration, Teamwork, and Flexibility: The candidate should demonstrate the ability to collaborate as a team member with key external stakeholders, county-based staff, and other colleagues within UC ANR.

• Lifelong Learning: There is an expectation that Advisors evolve and grow across their careers and respond to changes in the industry, clientele, and organizational structure.

• As a condition of employment, the finalist will be required to disclose if they are subject to any final administrative or judicial decisions within the last seven years determining that they committed any misconduct, are currently being investigated for misconduct, left a position during an investigation for alleged misconduct, or have filed an appeal with a previous employer. ""Misconduct"" means any violation of the policies or laws governing conduct at the applicant's previous place of employment, including, but not limited to, violations of policies or laws prohibiting sexual harassment, sexual assault, or other forms of harassment, discrimination, dishonesty, or unethical conduct, as defined by the employer.

POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH POSITION
Forest Structure, Species Distribution Modeling, and Global Biodiversity Footprints
The Betts Forest Landscape Ecology Lab in the Oregon State University College of Forestry is seeking
a highly motivated postdoctoral researcher to join an innovative project at the intersection of remote
sensing, species distribution modeling, global forest management impacts on biodiversity, and mapping
of trade-related extinctions. This position offers an exciting opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge
research that will inform sustainable forestry practices and global wood trade policies. The candidate
will be part of a growing network of scientists internationally seeking to reveal the environmental
impacts of global wood flow, with the project directly partnered with University of Cambridge (UK).
Project Overview
Global wood demand is projected to double by 2050 but forestry is already a major driver of biodiversity
loss, threatening over 30,000 species. This project aims to develop a predictive framework for assessing
how different forest management systems affect biodiversity at global scales. Building on recent
advances in remote sensing and species distribution models (SDMs), the postdoc will lead efforts to
model species responses—past and future—to forestry practices spanning major production systems
(e.g. clear-cutting, retention forestry, tropical selective logging, plantations, uneven- and even-aged
management) and unmanaged forests.
The researcher will collaborate with a growing Alliance on Global Wood Outcomes, integrating
biodiversity predictions with spatial data on forest structure and global wood trade to produce the most
advanced global estimates of extinction risks embedded in current and future wood supply chains. The
project will be based at Oregon State University and directly partnered with University of Cambridge
(UK).
Key Research Objectives
1. Characterizing Forestry Production Systems
● Analyze global forestry systems using time-series remote sensing data
● Quantify structural dynamics and classify forest management types at scale
2. Backcasting Species Distributions
● Develop SDMs across taxa for very many species using large-scale datasets (e.g., eBird,
GBIF, as well as in-house datasets)
● Reconstruct historical species-habitat relationships in different managed forest systems, plus
unmanaged forests
● Model species responses to historical wood production strategies over broad spatial scales
3. Forecasting Biodiversity Impacts of Wood Production
● Model future species responses to alternative wood production scenarios● Quantify uncertainty and integrate predictions with extinction risk frameworks
The postdoc will work closely with international partners to link biodiversity impacts to species
extinction, forest trade and land-use models, generating policy-relevant tools for tracing impacts
through international wood flows.
Optional: According to the candidate’s availability and interests, there is scope for extended
collaborative research visits to the David Attenborough Building at the University of Cambridge, UK,
a global hub of conservation scientists and environmental non-governmental organisations.

Astor Environmental: Fisheries Biologist

If you are unable to complete this application due to a disability, contact Astor Environmental LLC at 503-812-0679 to ask for an accommodation or an alternative application process.

Astor Environmental LLC (Astor) is seeking candidates to support the NOAA Fisheries Fish Ecology Division at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) in developing habitat valuation models for listed Pacific salmon species to support consultations under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). 

Background:
 In 1999, Puget Sound Chinook salmon were listed as threatened under the ESA. Listings under the ESA mandate NOAA Fisheries take several actions including the development of recovery plans as well as the designation and protection of critical habitat. Under ESA Section 7, NOAA is required to provide consultations on permitted activities that may have adverse effects on designated habitat to ensure critical habitat remains protected and/or sufficient mitigation is achieved. To-date, the majority of consultations are done on a case-by-case basis whereby NOAA biologists determine the likelihood of adverse affect and the associated mitigation requirements for individual applicants. Such a method can suffer from inconsistency and result in backlogs should the number of consultations far exceed available NOAA staff. Developing tools that improve the accuracy, efficiency, and transparency of the consultation process are of high priority.
 Accurately quantifying fish – habitat relationships is critical for successful habitat restoration/conservation in support of population recovery for listed species. Habitat valuation models are used to translate these relationships into key population parameters (e.g. abundance, growth, productivity) as a function of habitat gains or losses. Specifically, these models use known relationships between habitat attributes and fish populations to determine the relative value of a given location based upon the loss/gain of function for listed species and, if applicable, predict the level of mitigation required for permitted actions. Incorporating knowledge of habitat function and population response into a systematic or programmatic tool will increase the accuracy and significantly improve the efficiency and transparency of the consultation process reducing the burden on both NOAA biologists and permit applicants. 
 Under this task order, the employee, in partnership with the Fish Ecology Division at NWFSC and the NOAA West Coast Regional Office, will develop habitat valuation models for listed Pacific salmon species to support consultations under the ESA. This work will focus on creating a new model for estuarine habitats and update current models for nearshore environments. Specifically, the contractor will aggregate and synthesize estuary and nearshore marine habitat data at multiple scales to correlate with existing fish data to create a predictive tool to evaluate the relative values of specific locations and the estimated functional value for fish populations for determining mitigation needs. Tool(s) developed under this contract will directly enable NOAA to fulfill its mission to protect critical habitat for listed populations of Chinook salmon. New models may build off previously developed valuation model frameworks for Puget Sound nearshore habitats but should seek improvements regarding model sensitivity, uncertainty, and improved user interface to increase efficiency. In addition, model components quantifying habitat contribution to salmonid food webs may assist concurrent efforts to incorporate food web dynamics into salmon life cycle models.

Duties:


Support the NMFS Fish Ecology Division in developing habitat valuation models for estuarine habitats to support ESA consultations for listed Pacific salmon and steelhead populations. 
Assist staff scientists with creating a framework for habitat valuation in estuarine ecosystems to reflect accurate fish—habitat relationships for Pacific salmon species. 

Provide critical updates to Puget Sound Nearshore Conservation Calculator adjustment factors.
Assist staff scientists, and in collaboration with the NOAA Regional Office, with updating and revising specific components of the Puget Sound Nearshore Conservation Calculator. 
Support improvements to the adjustment factors through the development of a spatially explicit salmon distribution tool (aka “salmon heat map”) that incorporates several habitat and environmental metrics relevant to salmon use of nearshore marine shorelines throughout the region.

Start Date: ASAP

Location: NWFSC Montlake Lab, Seattle, WA

Salary and Benefits: This is a full-time position with a generous benefit package. Salary: $33.00 to $36.00 per hour.

Required Knowledge and Experience:

Education – MS degree, or higher, from an accredited college or university with a focus directly related to a field of study as described above with emphasis in ecology, fisheries, statistics, natural sciences

Experience – 1 to 2 years of relevant experience, including with general salmon ecology, familiarity with estuarine and freshwater ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest, quantitative and spatial analysis in R and ARC GIS. PhD may be substituted for experience.

Only qualified applicants that meet minimum experience or background requirements stated above need apply.

Description
 *Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNWRS) located in Hilo, Hawaii.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: Natural ecosystems are becoming homogenized by the introduction and establishment of non-native species.  Our study area, the lowland wet forests (LWF) of Hawai‘i, have been subject to high rates of invasion due to geography and human colonization.  However, non-native species removal is expensive and time-consuming, and some non-native species may be playing important roles in the community by providing ecosystem goods and services. The Liko Na Pilina Project seeks to develop a strategy utilizing the functional traits of plants to purposefully create new ecosystems that maintain themselves with relatively little input, and that are capable of sequestering substantial amounts of carbon, sustaining a broad range of native biological diversity, and staying open enough at ground level to allow human movement through them. Our overall objective is to develop and evaluate a set of what we call “hybrid ecosystems,” in which a mix of native and non-native species maintains valuable forest structure and ecosystem services. The participant will support this Liko Na Pilina restoration experiment and be mentored as part of a collaborative team of the USDA Forest Service, University of Hawaii at Hilo, and the Hawaii Army National Guard. 

The participant will be involved with field data collections, field research plot maintenance, greenhouse planting, laboratory sample processing, and data entry. Field data collections are focused on:

Collecting data on tree growth and survival, seed production, litterfall, and phenology;
Conducting regular plot maintenance (weeding and herbicide application), and;
Planting desirable species mixes into target restoration areas across the larger landscape.
Greenhouse plantings will focus on:

Propagation of desirable plants of future restoration efforts, and;
General upkeep of the greenhouse space. 
Laboratory sample processing will focus on: post-processing (i.e., sorting and weighing) litterfall/seed rain samples. Data entry will focus on entering data collected in the field and lab into ongoing data sets.

Field conditions can be hot or rainy. Terrain is very uneven as plots are located on 'a'a lava substrates. Day to day activities of the participant will involve hiking and standing and may include lifting containers weighing up to 35 pounds. 

Learning Objectives: The fellow will build knowledge, experience, and competence in the following areas:

Plant identification and vegetation monitoring techniques
Applied hands-on restoration strategies
Plant propagation technique for species with diverse needs
Standard ecological sample processing protocols 
Data entry, management, and analysis
Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Susan Cordell (susan.cordell@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: October 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for 10 months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is part time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $1646.67 - $1,820.00 monthly.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.

Description
 Position: The Montaña Aquatic Ecology Lab (https://www.carmengmontana.com/) at the Department of Biology at Stephen F. Austin State University is recruiting a Master’s student to begin in Spring 2026 (January 2026) The position is funded for 2 years, and will be based in the research group of Dr. Montaña at Stephen F. Austin State University (SFASU). Student will receive a stipend of $2,000/month and Nonresident (NR) tuition is waived (resident tuition fees apply). 
 Research Focus: This study will use a multiscale perspective to survey the freshwater fishes in streams/rivers of east Texas to identify relationships within basin-scale connectivity and stream flow and reach-scales physicochemical characteristics in the context of aiding the current distribution of imperiled fish species (shiners and suckers) within the Neches and Sabine River basins in Texas. 
This research will use a combination of fishing gears and sampling methods to accurately assess freshwater fishes with efforts focused on several native imperiled fish species. The surveys will be conducted on a yearly basis including three seasons (spring, summer, and fall) to better understand changes in fish assemblage dynamics over time. Surveys will also include multiscale habitat analysis to quantify habitats a finer (e.g., reach, mesohabitat) and broader (e.g., landscape) scales to help identify environmental variables associated with the occurrence of imperiled shiners and suckers over time. In addition, novel approaches based on PIT tagging and stable isotope analysis of carbon [δ13C], nitrogen [δ15N], and Sulfur (δ34S) will be conducted to evaluate and monitor movement patterns and habitat use by proposed imperiled species within the Neches and Sabine River basins. 
 Desired Qualifications: Individuals with research interests in aquatic ecology, fish ecology/fisheries, river/stream ecology, food-web ecology, and/or conservation ecology are especially encouraged to apply. Candidates must hold a Bachelor’s degree by the start date in Biology, Ecology, Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences, or related field. Demonstrated experience in fish sampling and identification; use of water quality meters, proficiency in Microsoft Office (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint), have an understanding of biodiversity metrics. Coding in R, ArGIS skills, and stable isotope processing is a plus, though all of these can be learned during graduate school. Experience with driving a boat/trailer is required. The ability to conduct rigorous fieldwork under extreme conditions (e.g., heat, humidity) will be necessary. Excellent communication, time-management skills, a strong work ethic and attention to detail also are essential. Self-motivated and able to work independently and collaboratively is expected. The candidate must also have a valid driver’s license (will need to get a Texas driver license). 
 About the Area/University: SFASU is located in Nacogdoches, Texas. The Department of Biology has (http://www.sfasu.edu/academics/colleges/sciences-math/biology) a diverse faculty with strengths in ecology and evolutionary ecology, conservation biology, botany, and cellular and molecular biology. Nacogdoches is a city with more than 33,000 residents. 
 Deadline: Review of applications will start October 30th 2025 and continue until the position is filled. The candidate is expected to begin in Spring 2026 (January 2026). Please send only one PDF file to Dr. Carmen Montaña (montanascg@sfasu.edu) with the following documents: 1) a cover letter outlining your research interests and experiences, 1) GPA scores,  3) Undergraduate transcripts (unofficial are accepted), 4) Curriculum vitae, 5)GRE scores (if available), 6) contact details of three references and 7) an example of your writing.

WRA is seeking a Landscape Architecture Director to lead our Landscape Architecture Group within our interdisciplinary Riverscapes and Shorelines Team. The desired candidate will collaborate and engage both internally and externally to lead, support, and deliver a diverse range of design projects focused primarily on ecological restoration, with the capability to support parks and open space and community resilience projects as needed.  

You will join our team of restoration design professionals and scientists, including engineers, landscape architects, fluvial geomorphologists, hydrologists, and ecologists. Our projects span a variety of ecosystems and types across California including San Francisco Bay tidal marshes and living shorelines, Sierra Nevada meadow restoration, Northern California Coast floodplain and salmonid restoration, California Central Coast estuary restoration, and Bay Area and Southern California urban stream rehabilitation. Additionally, our team is actively growing and pursuing restoration work in Oregon. We are passionate about restoring riverine and coastal systems that support healthy and resilient natural and human communities, and are invested in the entire restoration process from initial site selection to performance monitoring and adaptive management. We also frequently collaborate with our parks and open space and community resilience teams to integrate ecological restoration with recreation and educational opportunities such as trails, gathering spaces, and interpretive features, as well as tackling challenges such as sea-level rise and wildfire resiliency.

WRA has a diverse portfolio of projects and clients, including decades-long private clients, public agencies, and non-profit organizations. In addition to our technical expertise, we help clients meet their goals and visions by providing grant fund cultivation, preparing financial models, partnering with investors, engaging stakeholders, and facilitation services. 

We envision you working in-person at one of our San Francisco Bay Area offices or in a hybrid arrangement or remote location in this region of California. Other locations may be considered on a case by case basis. Regardless of your work arrangement, in-person, remote, or hybrid, you will be excited to collaborate with staff in many technical disciplines across the company.

At WRA, you will have 3 major areas of impact:

Technical Skills:

Learn more about being a member of Team WDFW!

 These positions play a key role in monitoring salmon and steelhead fisheries in the Tri-Cities area, with a focus on sport fishery monitoring during the fall season and assisting with stream surveys in the Hanford Reach and Yakima River from October through December. 

The data collected helps track fishing effort, harvest, and impacts on Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed species, ensuring that in-season harvest stays within regional allocations. These fisheries are managed under U.S. v. Oregon and guided by pre-season forecasts and ongoing updates from the Technical Advisory Committee. 

By gathering accurate biological and harvest information, technicians directly support run reconstruction, future forecasting, and assessments of both hatchery and natural populations. 

In short, the information you collect in these positions are vital to the sustainable management of salmon and steelhead in Washington waters.

Field Data Collection:
Sport Fishery Surveys: 
Conduct on-site interviews with anglers participating in salmon and steelhead sport fisheries at boat launches and shoreline access areas.
Estimate fishing effort through boat trailer index counts and angler interviews. 
Identify harvested fish to species and collect biological data including number, length, gender, fin clips, coded wire tags, and scales for aging.
Stream Surveys: 
Collect post-spawn salmon carcasses in-river by boat and along shorelines within the WDFW District 4 waters of the Columbia and Yakima Rivers. 
Follow sport fishery sampling protocols with the addition of otolith collection (for aging and origin) and egg retention assessments to evaluate spawning success.
Dissect female carcasses to determine spawning success.
