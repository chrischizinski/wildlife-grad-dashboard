Description
Position Summary
The Aldo Leopold Foundation’s Fellowship Program Coordinator will supervise and mentor 3 to 6 Leopold Fellows hired each year through the Future Leaders Fellowship Program. This position is responsible for the fellow’s overall experience and professional development as early career young adults in the environmental conservation field. A successful program will coordinate and schedule professional development sessions using subject matter experts to train the Leopold Fellows in the seven core areas. The Fellowship Program Coordinator will develop Leopold Fellows’ personal and professional growth and career connections. In addition to coordinating the Fellowship Program, this position will be responsible for assisting with the advancement of the Land Ethic Leader curriculum, an online, asynchronous training program currently in development and provide logistical support for other foundation programs (e.g., guided tours, visitor services, and crane programming) as needed.

Future Leaders Fellowship Program
Leadership in conservation is a critical piece to solving the ongoing and emerging environmental issues of today. The Aldo Leopold Foundation’s Future Leaders Fellowship Program is designed for individuals who have recently completed a college degree or have equivalent combination of education, training, and work experience. Fellows will gain experience and grow in seven core areas: professionalism and ethics, conservation leadership, strategic planning, education and interpretation, marketing and communications, philanthropy, applied science and natural history, and socioecology. Each of these areas is addressed through a professional development series and applied on-the-job experiences that allow for exploration of each topic and time for each Leopold Fellow to practice and apply these key elements of leadership.

Leopold Fellows will specialize in either Communications or Land Stewardship. Fellows get exposure to both program areas through either independent projects and/or other organizational efforts. Fellows also have the opportunity to interact with both a diverse range of conservation professionals and the Leopold community, including Leopold family members.

Fellowship Program Coordinator Position Impact Statement
The tradition of cultivating conservation leaders at the Aldo Leopold Foundation traces back to Aldo Leopold himself, whose mentorship of graduate students and his own children helped shape generations of environmental thinkers and practitioners. Today, this legacy continues through the Future Leaders Fellowship Program. As the Fellowship Program Coordinator, you play a central role in nurturing the next generation of conservation leaders by designing experiences that introduce, strengthen, and cultivate essential professional competencies—while also fostering the ethical awareness and relational perspective foundational to a contemporary land ethic.

This position creates opportunities for fellows to work alongside a community of practitioners, scholars, and mentors across the conservation field, allowing them to see how ethical decision-making, community engagement, and ecological responsibility play out in practice. We anticipate that program alumni will go on to lead in nonprofits, government agencies, universities, and private organizations. This position also contributes to expanding the program’s reach, impact, and visibility through new partnerships and emerging opportunities, furthering the foundation’s commitment to growing ethical conservation leaders for the 21st century.

Description
The Montana Master Naturalist Program is designed for people who want to stoke their curiosity, deepen their knowledge of the natural world, and give back to their communities in new ways. We hope that participants will not only build the skills to interpret Montana’s flora, fauna, and landscape, but that they will also gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the natural world, and therefore become better stewards of it. This program is an excellent certification for those looking to pursue a career in environmental education or interpretive guiding, or those just looking to enhance their connection to place. During six days of experiential, field-based education, participants learn to identify species, interpret behaviors, and affirm ecological relationships. This foundational, applied knowledge not only enriches a sense of place, but also builds the confidence, attention, and curiosity to respect and conserve diverse ecosystems.

RIO GRANDE CUTTHROAT TROUT PHD ASSISTANTSHIP

Description & project background: 

The Pregler Lab at New Mexico State University in the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Ecology invites applications for a PhD research assistantship focused on Rio Grande cutthroat trout conservation. The successful applicant will begin in the Fall 2026 semester.

Rio Grande cutthroat trout (RGCT) are the southernmost species of cutthroat trout and have experienced a severe decline in both range and abundance, now occupying only ~12 percent of its historical distribution and requires targeted management interventions to support recovery. Major components of the recovery plan detail the need to secure extant populations and reintroduce individuals within their native range in Colorado and New Mexico. Recent efforts to date include development of a multi-source, genetically diverse broodstock for the Rio Grande basin that is used for reintroduction efforts.

Individuals from this multi-source broodstock were stocked at multiple sites throughout the recently restored Rio Costilla watershed which represents one of the largest native fish restoration projects in the country. While recent research has shown that this composite broodstock is more genetically diverse compared to using single source populations there is a need to evaluate how these fish are performing in the wild. The present project has a number of goals:

          1. Evaluate genetic structure and diversity of reintroduced Rio Costilla RGCT populations
                     a. There is also opportunity to develop questions with demographic monitoring data in this system.
          2. Genetic assessment of Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos basins. 
                     a. Results will help inform multi-source broodstock development for Canadian & Pecos basins and identify additional source populations for Rio Grande basin.
                     b. Results will also provide an updated genetic assessment for RGCT.
          3. There are additional opportunities for the student to develop their own questions using genetic and demographic data.

This project is a collaborative effort funded by the New Mexico Department of Wildlife and there may be potential to collaborate with other university researchers and agencies. Benefits include a salary range of ~$28-29k/year, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance. Funding will also be available for conference travel, workshop training for data analyses, and safety training (e.g., wilderness first aid). The hired candidate will begin in Fall 2026 and will be based at NMSU in Las Cruces, NM.

How to apply: If interested, please compile the following: (1) a statement of interest that describes your educational and research background, as well as your research interests and how this position fits in your career goals (2) curriculum vitae or resume, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts compiled in a single PDF and save as ‘Lastname_RGCT_PhD.pdf’.  Applicants are also asked to upload a writing sample in the application portal. Applications should be submitted through the airtable linked here:  https://airtable.com/app3jNqbQZsYstwx7/pagrpU5GqaI6FnSTg/form 

Applications are due 03/18/26 by 11:59p MT. You can learn more about the Pregler Lab at https://preglerlab.com and any questions about the position can be sent to Dr. Kasey Pregler at kpregler@nmsu.edu.   

Qualifications: 

Required: B.S. in fisheries, biology, or related field and possession of a valid U.S. driver’s license. The successful applicant must also meet the minimum requirements for admission to the NMSU Graduate School (3.0 GPA in last two years of undergrad). Applicants should also have demonstrated excellent written and oral communication skills, and an ability to work independently. 

Preference will be given to applicants with an M.S. degree in fisheries, biology, or related field and have experience working in the backcountry and are willing to lead field work crews in backcountry conditions.

Successful candidates will have proficiency in R, and an interest in genetics and working with large datasets. They should also demonstrate the ability to work as part of a team and have a willingness to lead field work crews in remote backcountry locations. Applicants with experience in fish ecology, statistical & genetic analysis, and hierarchical modeling are encouraged to apply.

PhD Scholarship
Transforming Climate Action – Uncertain Seas 
 
A PhD Scholarship is available at the Centre for Fisheries Ecosystems Research, Fisheries & Marine Institute, Memorial University, St. John’s, NL, Canada.

Transforming Climate Action is a seven year, $397 million collaboration among Dalhousie University, Laval University, University Québec at Rimouski, and Memorial University. The largest research theme within Transforming Climate Action is Reducing Uncertainties in Carbon Cycling in the Northwest Atlantic Seas (Uncertain Seas). The goal of Uncertain Seas is to better constrain the role of the ocean in the Earth’s climate system by reducing uncertainties with physical and biogeochemical processes that control the global ocean carbon cycle. The focus is on the Northwest Atlantic gateway as a major contributor to ocean carbon uptake and sequestration, particularly with respect to the biological carbon pump.
We are seeking a PhD Student to estimate carbon fluxes in the Northwest Atlantic from Earth system and ecosystem models. As a part of Transforming Climate Action, there will be opportunities to participate in workshops with other graduate students from the four institutions. There will also be opportunities for research visits to collaborating labs and conference travel. There may be opportunities to participate in research expeditions, although not a requirement.  

Location: The student will be enrolled in the PhD in Fisheries Science graduate program at the Fisheries & Marine Institute, Memorial University, in St. John’s, NL, Canada.  Memorial University is a hub of ocean sciences located in the Province’s capital. St. John’s is a safe and friendly city with great historical charm, known for its hospitality, live music, a vibrant cultural life, and easy access to wilderness and a wide range of outdoor activities.

PhD Assistantship: UT Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit
Technical and Experimental Aquatics Laboratory 
Department of Watershed Sciences/Wildland Resources 
Utah State University, Logan UT

Project Description: We are recruiting a PhD student to begin in Fall 2026 to investigate eradication strategies of one of the worst invasive species in the Southwestern U.S.; the Red Shiner Cyprinella lutrensis. Red Shiner are a persistent and ecologically detrimental invasive species, negatively impacting aquatic ecosystems throughout the West. Control of invasive Red Shiner populations is widely ineffective utilizing existing management tools. Therefore, alternative management strategies are necessary, such as skewing invasive population sex ratios towards all males through YY fish releases. The aim of this project is to determine the efficacy of YY Red Shiner releases by incorporating dispersal capabilities and population structure into management-ready models. 
 Position Duties: The goals of this project are to: 

1.      Conduct mark-recapture methods and population structure admixture analysis to estimate dispersal potential and interconnectivity of the Verde River, AZ and Virgin  
          River, NV Red Shiner populations, respectively. 
2.      Develop YY release simulations to assess the feasibility of eradicating invasive Red Shiner populations 

This position will entail extensive field work and coordination with multiple state and federal biologists to sample the Verde River, AZ and Virgin River, NV. The student will deploy PIT tag arrays, conduct Red Shiner population estimates, and collect DNA samples in remote and inhospitable field locations. The student will lead a population admixture analysis utilizing DNA samples. Ultimately, the student will incorporate their data into simulations of YY Red Shiner releases to inform management on the scale of effectiveness for YY Red Shiner release scenarios. The student will author manuscripts and present at conferences to disseminate findings. The student will develop highly applicable skills for future careers in fisheries, genetics, ecology, and natural resource management, and will obtain mentoring experience by supervising undergraduate research technicians. The partners and sponsors for this project are an excellent team of scientists from federal and state agencies. The selected student will be advised by Dr. Chad Teal (U.S. Geological Survey, Utah State University) in the Technical and Experimental Aquatics Lab. In addition to these research duties, the student will need to successfully complete the required coursework, author and defend a dissertation, and graduate with their PhD within 5 years of starting. 

Qualifications: M.S. in fisheries, ecology, quantitative methods, natural resource management, or other related fields with a minimum 3.2 GPA. A good work ethic is mandatory. Experience in leading field work is preferred. Writing, organizational, data management skills, and quantitative skills are required, as well as the ability to maintain positive working relationships with members of the lab, department, and stakeholder groups. Only applicants that can obtain a valid U.S. driver’s license by start date need apply. Utah State University does not discriminate or tolerate discrimination, including harassment, based on race, religion, sex, national origin, age, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, status as a protected veteran, or any other status protected by University policy, Title IX, or any other federal, state, or local law

Description
The Dryland Ecosystem Ecology Lab in the Department of Integrative Biology (soon to be the Department of Biology) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison invites applications for a fully funded PhD position focused on nutrient and carbon redistribution in dryland ecosystems under global change. The Dryland Ecosystem Ecology Lab is a new research group focused on understanding how global change reshapes dryland ecosystem structure and function across spatial scales.
 This project investigates how global change–driven shifts in vegetation structure, biological soil crust cover, and sediment retention lead to non-linear changes in nutrient and carbon loss and spatial redistribution across dryland landscapes. The successful candidate will study how ecosystem state transitions influence nitrogen and carbon cycling across scales. The research will integrate multiple approaches and disciplines, including biogeochemistry, ecosystem ecology, soil science, plant and biological soil crust physiology, and microbial ecology. The student will gain experience using a range of field and laboratory techniques. Following initial project development, the PhD student will have flexibility to design an independent research program aligned with the broader goal of understanding dryland ecosystem responses to global change. The student will receive close mentorship while developing independence as a researcher.
 Fieldwork will occur in dryland ecosystems in the southwestern United States.
 Funding and Support
The position includes five years of guaranteed support (including summers) through a combination of research and teaching assistantships, along with a full tuition waiver. Current assistantship stipend information is available at: https://grad.wisc.edu/funding/graduate-assistantships/

Description
Project Description:
This position is for a quantitative fisheries PhD student working with Dr. Edward Camp at the University of Florida. This position is funded by an interdisciplinary project that will knit together biological, ecological, socioeconomic, and integrated empirical and model-based assessments to understand the consequences of changing marine fishery systems on fishers and management. The specific position is expected to study shifts in fish species availability, and subsequent responses of fishers to such shifts. The work is expected to involve quantitative analyses of existing fisheries dependent and/or independent data from federal or state agencies. The project will also have opportunities to develop related socioecological models that may be used to consider the consequences of shifting fish and fishers on management actions and approaches. 
This position is intended to be part of a cohort of 3-4 students working on related aspects of changing socioecological systems from biological, ecological, socioeconomic, and integrated perspectives. As the project will also work closely with managers and fishers, this position will afford the successful applicant opportunities to interact and learn about fisheries governance and fishing communities. The work is expected to focus especially on Florida’s Gulf coast and may involve voluntary travel, but the student will be based in Gainesville and will not be required to conduct field work. The position should start between August 2026 and January 2027.

Description
2 Ph.D. Positions on Enhancing American marten regional connectivity in the Upper Great Lakes (UW-Madison)  

 

Overview: We are seeking two outstanding Ph.D. students to lead complementary components of a National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) America the Beautiful Challenge-funded project examining how forest structure and silvicultural practices influence American marten ecology and regional population recovery. The project offers a unique opportunity to work at the interface of forest management, wildlife conservation, and landscape ecology, helping to develop management strategies that support high-quality marten habitat while maintaining key ecosystem services—including productive and economically viable timber harvest. The research is designed to produce outcomes that are directly relevant to land managers and conservation partners.

 

PhD Position 1: 

The student’s dissertation will involve: (1) non-invasively monitoring of American marten populations to assess distribution, population size and vital rates; (2) live-capture individual martens to deploy GPS collars for habitat, space use and movement data and (3) analyze movement and demographic data simultaneously to estimate individual-to-population level responses of martens to forest management practices. This position will be advised by Dr. Jonathan Pauli (https://pauli.russell.wisc.edu/).  

 

PhD Position 2: 

The student’s dissertation will involve:  (1) synthesizing ecological and remotely sensed data from the National Ecological Observation Network (NEON) to characterize forest structure, productivity, and disturbance; (2) quantifying habitat attributes important to martens, such as coarse woody debris, canopy complexity, and multi-layered forest structure and (3) evaluating trade-offs between habitat suitability (e.g., landscape connectivity and movement corridors) and forest management objectives across spatial scales. This position will be co-advised by Dr. Jonathan Pauli (https://pauli.russell.wisc.edu/) and Amy Trowbridge (https://forestandwildlifeecology.wisc.edu/people/faculty-and-staff/trowbridge-amy/)

 

Both students will be enrolled in the Wildlife Ecology Ph.D. program housed in the Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and will collaborate closely with partners at the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to improve habitat quality and enhance population connectivity for Wisconsin’s endangered American marten on national forest lands.

 

Qualifications: Applicants should hold a M.S. degree in ecology, wildlife, forestry, conservation, or other related discipline, though students with a B.S. degree and substantial, relevant experience are also encouraged to apply. Successful candidates will have a solid foundation in terrestrial ecology, field research, and quantitative or statistical methods. Experience with mammal trapping and handling, remote sensing, GIS, or spatial ecological data is a plus. Because this project is highly collaborative, we are especially interested in students who have worked with natural resource agencies or applied conservation partners. Prior experience with scientific writing is preferred and strong English writing and communication skills are essential. We especially welcome applications from students enrolled in federally recognized Tribes or who have experience working with Indigenous communities.

 

Salary: Both positions are four-year funded projects that include a competitive annual stipend ($37,414), plus tuition remission and health care benefits. 

 

Start Date: Fall semester of 2026 (both positions)

Review of applicants will begin on March 1st, 2026, but the position will remain open until a suitable candidate is found.

To apply: Please submit your application here: https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4NtwDNs7IGErPoi 

Submitting an application includes filling out a small survey and takes approximately 15 minutes. It requires contact information for three references, and to upload in PDF format:

Description
I am seeking two motivated master’s students with an interest in crop physiology and environmental stress research. Our research program focuses on understanding how plants perceive and adapt to adverse environmental conditions, with the ultimate goal of protecting crops and mitigating damage caused by environmental stress.

Tomato will be used as the primary research model, as it is both one of the most important vegetable crops worldwide and an excellent model plant for environmental science research. Students will grow tomato plants in our greenhouse, harvest fruits at the mature green stage, and store them under different temperature conditions to investigate the effects of heat stress on fruit ripening.

Project 1: Stable Carbon Isotope Fractionation and Fruit Respiration
One student will focus on developing a novel approach using stable carbon isotope fractionation to monitor the effects of heat stress on fruit respiration pathways, which are closely linked to fruit productivity. Although stable isotope fractionation is widely used in geochemistry, it has rarely been applied to the study of fruit ripening. This approach will provide a multidimensional perspective on how heat stress influences fruit respiratory metabolism. This project includes a collaboration with Rice University, where the student will spend approximately one week each year conducting specialized isotope measurements.

Project 2: Role of Abscisic Acid (ABA) in Heat Stress Tolerance
The second student will investigate the role of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) in tomato plant development and fruit ripening, with a particular focus on its involvement in heat stress responses and resistance mechanisms. This project will compare wild-type tomatoes with mutant lines that have reduced or enhanced ABA accumulation in fruits, with the goal of understanding how ABA influences fruit survival under heat stress conditions.

Through two years of research training, students will gain a strong foundation in the concepts and techniques of environmental stress research, develop proficiency with relevant laboratory and greenhouse instrumentation, and acquire skills essential for careers in environmental science research, agricultural chemistry, and environmental monitoring.

Funding and Qualifications
Prospective students with an interest in agricultural chemistry are encouraged to apply. Students will be supported as teaching assistants, receiving a $15,000 annual stipend and $7,000 in tuition remission, distributed equally across the three academic terms.

Applicants should have a bachelor’s degree in chemistry, biology, agriculture, environmental science, or a related discipline, along with strong written and verbal communication skills and the ability to work both independently and as part of a research team.

Application Process
Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, with the position closing on March 31, 2026. The anticipated start date is September 2026.

Please submit one PDF file containing a cover letter, curriculum vitae, transcripts, and the names and contact information of three references to:

Description
The Integrative Wildlife Conservation lab at Trent University is initiating new research on the movement, feeding, and spatial dynamics of snowshoe hares at Kluane Lake, Yukon, Canada. Hares have been studied for >40 years on-site, and this new work will investigate the role of food and vegetative structure on hare behavioural repertoires in the context of their 10-year population cycles. Hares live on a fine edge between risk of predation/starvation vs. sustainable nutrition, setting the stage for critical behavioural tradeoffs though space and time. Using archived as well as new GPS telemetry and accelerometry data, combined with assays of structural cover and food availability/quality from remote sensing, the project will address some of the following questions: 1) Whether hares adjust movements and feeding behaviours in response to variation in food and cover, and 2) If hare responses are fine-tuned according to cyclic population dynamics and corresponding variation in predation risk and conspecific density. It is uncertain how hares survive on low-quality woody browse and limited shrub cover during winter, setting the stage for using hyperspectral imaging and LiDAR to help develop: 3) Maps of hare nutritional/structural cover landscapes through space and time, and 4) Relating hare behaviours to these complex, variable environments. Additional remote sensing using ground penetrating radar (GPR) can further support these efforts by: 5) Addressing the role of local snow conditions (depth, hardness) on food/cover availability, and corresponding hare responses through the winter season. Data resulting from such research could support dynamic models exploring how hares respond to environmental variation under climate change. The PhD student will have the opportunity to develop specific research questions within the scope of the larger project.

The successful applicant MUST have an MSc in Ecology, Conservation Biology, or related field, demonstrated evidence of peer-reviewed publications, strong field and quantitative skills, and an interest in working collaboratively within a large and diverse research group. Additional desirable skills include animal handling, Remote sensing and post-processing, GPS telemetry, application of animal movement models and spatial analysis, and working in remote field conditions, including during winter.  For additional details, see www.dennismurray.ca. 

To apply, send a cover letter, curriculum vitae, unofficial academic transcript, and contact information for 3 references to: Dennis Murray (dennismurray@trentu.ca). 

The position will be filled as soon as a suitable candidate is found.

Description
 The Integrative Wildlife Conservation lab at Trent University is offering a PhD position on the application of remote sensing tools for assessing the state of boreal forest structure and dynamics near Kluane Lake, Yukon, Canada. For decades our team studied vertebrates in the boreal forest ecosystem in the region, and we are now extending this  work to address pressing questions related to vegetation and snow dynamics in this rapidly-changing northern landscape. Using an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with LiDAR, multispectral, and RGB sensors, and combined with archived satellite data for the region, the PhD student may investigate some of the following questions: 1) Patterns of forest productivity, regeneration, and phenology across space and time, and 2) Sources of forest structural heterogeneity and resilience to insect outbreaks or fire. A high priority is to understand how the boreal forest may be impacted by climate change, which can be accomplished by: 3) Combining and back-casting remote sensing products to predict past changes to forest structural cover and deciduous vegetation composition (shrubification). Likewise, we are interested in understanding how variable snow conditions may affect winter forest dynamics and ecology of terrestrial mammals by: 4) Using ground penetrating radar and LiDAR to identify the determinants of local snow conditions (hardness, density). Ultimately, these investigations can lead to: 5) Forecasts of future boreal forest and snow dynamics under IPCC climate change scenarios. The PhD student will have the opportunity to develop specific research questions within the scope of the larger project. 
 The successful applicant MUST have an MSc in Ecology, Geography, Remote Sensing, or a related field, demonstrated evidence of peer-reviewed publications, strong field and quantitative skills, some experience with GIS and related analysis, and an interest in working collaboratively within a large and diverse research group. Additional desirable skills include experience in drone operation, data post-processing, and working in remote field conditions.

Description
Funded PhD Student Opportunity with the Howe lab at Utah State University 
 Discipline Areas: Forest Ecology, Disturbance Ecology, Forest Health, Social Science 
Research Topic: Managing USDA wildfire crisis strategy landscapes in the Intermountain West, Forest Service Region 4. 
Start Date: as early as January 2026 and until the positions are filled 
Compensation: PhD 3-years of $24,500 annual stipend plus benefits (tuition, fees, and insurance), and travel allowance 
Requirements: MS required  

National Needs Fellows at Utah State University: Utah State University’s Quinney College of Natural Resources seeks 2 MS students and 2 PhD students to join us as a cohort of National Needs Fellows, in support of a United States Department of Agriculture project funded to facilitate management of Forest Service, Region 4 Wildfire Crisis Strategy Landscapes (https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/wildfire-crisis). Up to four graduate students are sought to participate in a graduate research project and to work as a cohort to navigate structured activities designed to improve their understanding of the scientific rationale underpinning forest resources management. Mandatory student activities will include: 1) teamwork skill development; 2) collective involvement in extension and seminar-type activities focused on building leadership skills; 3) development of mentoring skills, and; 4) training in state-of-the-art tools and skills. These activities will be delivered through mentoring from the project team of faculty advisors. Ultimately, the goal is to advance training in line with increasing workforce development in the field of Forest Resources.

Project Motivation: There has been a documented increase in the extent of forested landscapes that have experienced both outbreaks by forest insect herbivores and wildfire. The impact of overlapping biotic-abiotic disturbance (i.e., compound disturbance) on fuels, forest structure, and post-disturbance recovery is severely understudied, especially across Utah and Region 4.

Project Goals: The student will: A) Quantify the extent of forested landscapes that have experienced both biotic and abiotic disturbances across Utah and Region 4; B) Quantify forest structure and regeneration in areas that have experienced biotic disturbance (bark beetle-caused tree mortality), abiotic disturbance (wildfire), or both based on the areas identified above; C) Based on results, identify high risk landscapes for active management or mitigation efforts; and D) Quantify how land managers and members of the public perceive wildfire risk. 

Collaboration: This project is collaborative, and the student will work closely with the primary faculty advisor (Dr. Michael Howe) as well as Dr. Larissa Yocom (https://larissayocom.com/), Dr. Jim Lutz (http://jamesalutz.com/), Dr. Justin DeRose (http://qcnr.usu.edu/labs/derose/), and Dr. Catrin Edgeley (https://catrinedgeley.weebly.com/).    
 We will all work closely as a team. Students are expected to maintain clean, organized databases, lead contributions to collective projects and publish their work in peer-reviewed scientific journals. They will have opportunities to present their work to diverse audiences, including private landowners, policymakers, and the scientific community. Candidates should have earned a BS or MS (preferred) related to forestry, entomology, ecology, etc. Highly qualified candidates with degrees in other fields will be considered. Preferred qualifications include qualitative and quantitative skills and field experience. Review of applications will start immediately and continue until the position is filled. 
 To apply, please email the following to Michael Howe (mike.howe@usu.edu) as soon as possible: 1) a cover letter describing your experience and interest, 2) a CV or resume, 3) unofficial transcripts, 4) GRE scores if you have them (not mandatory), and 5) a list of three professional references and their contact information.

 M.S. Assistantship – Raven Movement Ecology in Prairie Canada
Dr. Adam Janke & Dr. Gunnar Kramer – Iowa State University
Dr. Jay VonBank, Dr. Todd Arnold, Dr. Frank Rohwer & Jacob Bushaw – Delta Waterfowl Foundation
 PROJECT BACKGROUND
Delta Waterfowl, in collaboration with Iowa State University (ISU), is recruiting a highly motivated M.S. student to investigate the movement ecology of common ravens and their role in waterfowl nest depredation within the prairie/parkland ecosystems of Saskatchewan, Canada. Ravens represent a relatively new and increasingly abundant nest predator in this region, and their expanding distribution poses emerging challenges for waterfowl reproductive success.
 This research will focus on quantifying spatial and temporal movement patterns of ravens using advanced GPS telemetry. The student will investigate how raven movement strategies, habitat-use dynamics, and associated behaviors contribute to waterfowl nest depredation. Results from this work will directly inform predator management strategies to enhance conservation planning for waterfowl populations within the northern Prairie Pothole Region. The selected candidate will collaborate closely with scientists from Delta Waterfowl and Iowa State University. Field operations will begin in April 2026 in Saskatchewan, and the graduate assistantship will formally begin at Iowa State University, Ames, IA, in August 2026.
 The assistantship is supported by a combination of teaching and research assistantships that provides a $28,800 per year stipend, health insurance, and a 75% tuition waiver.
 REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS 
• B.S. in ecology, wildlife biology, wildlife management, or a related discipline 
• Eligibility for admission to Iowa State University (including a GPA >3.0)
• Demonstrated commitment to high-quality, collaborative scientific research
PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS 
• Prior experience in movement ecology, avian ecology, or waterfowl nesting ecology 
• Experience with avian capture, safe handling procedures, or deployment of tracking transmitters

Description
A graduate assistantship for a master’s student is expected to be funded at Colorado State University (Fort Collins, CO) working with Dr. Brian D. Gerber (https://bgerber123.github.io/) at the Colorado Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and wildlife researchers at Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The graduate research assistantship will cover university tuition, fees, health coverage, and includes a pre-tax monthly pay of $3000/month. The position is expected to start Fall 2026 and be funded through December 2028.

Study Context: Sex and age class are important demographic parameters used in population modeling, in which the results help guide management decisions and annual harvest quotas of large mammals (e.g., elk, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, mule deer). This work will help develop new methodology and workflows that will aid Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s objective of producing robust empirical demographic data and population estimates for harvested wildlife. 

Focus: The focus of this study will be to collect data on the size distribution of elk sex and age classes (cow, calf, bull) to train and test a predictive approach using AI algorithms (developed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife) to classify animals from high-resolution aerial imagery. Field observations and size measurements (via 3D camera) will be collected to help test the accuracy of AI predictions. An additional avenue of exploration may be data collection and AI classification of sex/age class from camera trap images. The student will be expected to develop a project proposal outlining study objectives in coordination with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and a graduate committee at Colorado State University. The student will focus on technological and software workflows to meet study objectives, however, there will likely be field work opportunities as well (e.g., field observations, drone/aerial surveys). Given the trajectory of the wildlife field, the skills gained in this study will likely be desirable for future employers. 

 Preferred Qualifications: 

-          Ungulate field research experience in the intermountain west
-          Clear interest or experience developing data analysis workflows
-          Clear interest or experience advancing technological innovation (hardware/software) in wildlife science
-          Experience deploying camera traps and managing large data sets
-          Experience with AI algorithms, for example MegaDetector or SpeciesNet
 
Minimum Qualifications:
-          A Bachelor of Science degree in wildlife ecology, biology, natural resource management, or related field
-          A year or more of wildlife related professional research/work experience
-          Strong writing skills
-          Strong work ethic 
-          Desire to collaborate with state wildlife management agencies

To be considered, please send the following materials via email with “AI/Elk Application” as the subject line to Dr. Brian D.

Description
MS Assistantship: UT Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit
Technical and Experimental Aquatics Laboratory 
Department of Watershed Sciences/Wildland Resources 
Utah State University, Logan UT 

We are recruiting a Master of Science student to begin in Fall 2026 to investigate the sexual biology of a detrimental and pervasive invasive species within the Southwestern U.S.; the Green Sunfish Lepomis cyanellus. Green Sunfish is one of the fastest expanding invaders in the Southwest and are among the most invasive fish species due to their negative impacts on native fish communities. Management of invasive Green Sunfish populations requires highly intensive efforts and traditional removal techniques are seldomly effective. Therefore, alternative management strategies are necessary, such as skewing invasive population sex ratios towards all males through YY fish releases. This project will assess the feasibility of producing YY Green Sunfish by: 

1)     Investigating Green Sunfish genomes to uncover the sex determination system of this species and develop effective genetic sex ID markers. 
2)     Examining the effects of various environmental factors on the sex ratios of laboratory-reared Green Sunfish cohorts. 

Position Duties: This position entails field work (collecting broodstock and DNA from invasive populations), hatchery management (conducting heat and rearing density experiments), and lab work (DNA extractions, bioinformatic analyses, and sex ID marker development). The student will author manuscripts and present at conferences to disseminate findings.

M.S. Opportunity: Riparian restoration tools in working grasslands
The Genomics, Ecology, and Modeling for Conservation Lab at North Dakota State University, led by Travis Seaborn, is recruiting for one M.S. position to join our team working on a recently funded project in collaboration with the Albert K. Ekre Grassland Preserve. For more information on the preserve see: https://ndsufoundation.com/magazine/2021/09/ekre-grassland-preserve. 
 Anticipated start date: Summer 2026. Stiped ~$25,000 for 2-3 years. Tuition waiver also provided.
 The overall project will advance our ability to understand community responses to riparian restoration. Riparian ecosystems in the Northern Great Plains have been heavily altered by anthropogenic activities. Although there are numerous restoration options for riparian ecosystems, a common and effective restoration practice, in particular in incised stream systems, are beaver dam analogs. Using streams at the Ekre Grassland Preserve and nearby public land, we will be looking to do a restoration project using invasive buckthorn woody materials. To achieve this, we are beginning to plan a Before-After-Control-Impact design to assess riparian and floodplain ecosystem responses, including geomorphology, biological community, and water quality. Much of the beaver dam analog research that has been done has occurred in the western United States, and response to these activities in the Northern Great Plains is unknown. Surveys of the biological community may include electrofishing and minnow trapping for fish, camera traps for mammals, visual and auditory surveys for birds, and plant identification along transects.
 The primary goals of this position include:
1.    Identify the impact of beaver dam analogs.
2.    Using geographic information systems, develop beaver species distribution models for the region.
 To apply: Please email travis.seaborn@ndsu.edu a letter of interest, which should include an explanation of fit and past relevant experience, and CV by February 20th.

We are recruiting one graduate student (Ph.D. or M.S., depending on qualifications) as a National Graduate Research Trainee (NRT) funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to research pollinator services to both native and crop species. High preference will be given to individuals interested in work involving both native plants and crop species relevant to the U.S. Northern Great Plains region, as well as to those interested or experienced in nocturnal pollinators. The fellowship will be awarded to an incoming student pursuing an on-campus doctoral or master's degree within the Department of Earth System Science and Policy (ESSP) at the University of North Dakota (UND). The selected NRT fellow to work on this specific project will be jointly advised by the ESSP and the USDA ARS Northern Plains Agricultural Research Laboratory station in Montana.

The required qualifications for the candidate to work on this project are: 
having demonstrated interest in pollination ecology; 
having experience in insect sampling (especially pollinating insects) and proven ability to develop research questions, methodologies, and publish scientific reports (required for the PhD candidate)
willingness to work in remote or rural areas, including at night for nighttime pollinator surveys, in crop fields and grasslands, which may involve insect bites, wildlife encounters, intense sun, and varying temperatures
having ability to communicate effectively with landowners and land managers and to build strong partnerships

Description
The USGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center is seeking current or recent graduate students (post MS/PhD) for several projects on vegetation dynamics. Researchers may be involved in other projects on sage-grouse and ungulates, depending on skills and interests. 
 Projects focus on 1) mapping sagebrush and yellow sweet clover across the Northwestern Great Plains to support research on sage-grouse; 2) evaluating datasets for fractional cover of vegetation (e.g., RCMAP and RAP), and 3) evaluating vegetation responses to habitat restoration treatments across Montana and Wyoming, particularly for invasive annual grasses in the sagebrush ecosystem. Vegetation mapping involves analyses of imagery from UAVs, traditional aircraft, and satellites to map vegetation at high spatial resolutions across multiple states and years. Research on habitat restoration involves analyses of field survey data and time series of satellite-based data on vegetative cover. Researchers will be expected to 1) manipulate large, spatial datasets in a GIS, 2) analyze data (e.g., mixed models, machine learning algorithms), and 3) prepare manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals. 
 Positions are open to current graduate students or those recently graduated (MS or PhD preferred) that are eligible to work as a student contractor. Graduates that completed their degree within the past year are eligible to work as student contractors. Contracts can cover up to 1 (PhD) or 2 (MS) years of work. Opportunities for subsequent work through other appointments are possible. The start date, work schedule (i.e., full- versus part-time), and work location are negotiable; applicants that can start immediately and work full-time are preferred.    
 If interested, please send your resume, cover letter, and contact information for 3 or more references to Aaron Johnston at ajohnston@usgs.gov.

Research Project: The US National Poultry Research Center (USNPRC) is seeking a postdoctoral fellow to investigate the complex molecular interactions between Infectious Laryngotracheitis Virus (ILTV) and the host immune system. As an alphaherpesvirus, ILTV causes significant economic losses worldwide through respiratory distress and decreased production in poultry. This research specifically focuses on the characterization of virus-encoded immunoregulatory proteins, known as virokines, which serve as evolved mechanisms allowing the virus to subvert or evade the host’s innate and adaptive immune responses. By utilizing synthetic biology and reverse genetics, the participant will dissect the function of these proteins to identify targets for attenuation, ultimately leveraging these insights to engineer next-generation vaccine candidates using viral-vector platforms to bridge the gap between fundamental virology and applied veterinary medicine.

Research activities will include the characterization of novel ILTV-encoded virokines to determine their specific cellular targets within the avian immune system and develop novel vaccines. The fellow will determine the role of these immunomodulatory proteins in viral replication and pathogenesis using both in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, the project involves utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 and recombineering to generate mutant viruses lacking specific virokines to assess their potential as live-attenuated vaccine candidates. To ensure rigorous evaluation, the participant will establish standardized immunological assays to define the correlates of protection, focusing on both mucosal and systemic cellular responses. Finally, the project culminates in the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of these candidate vaccines within BSL-2 animal facilities.

Description
 *Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), located in Ames, Iowa.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: Many crop species have relatives that have also been domesticated, with selection independently being applied in the various species to modify traits such as seed size, dormancy, reduction of seed dispersal, changes in taste or toxic compounds, or changes in photoperiod sensitivity or plant architecture. Within the legume family, more than two dozen species have been domesticated, including plants such as pea, soybean, peanut, and common bean. The many related but independently domesticated species offer an opportunity to determine in which cases the domestications have occurred through modification of genetically corresponding (orthologous) genes, or via distinct, non-corresponding loci. This project will use a combination of analyses utilizing gene families, synteny relationships, genetic association results, and published gene functional information, to catalog and evaluate the genes involved in domestication in crops within the legume plant family. This research has applied value, through identification of genes that are likely to modify important domestication-related traits across many species. The research also addresses basic questions, such as whether domestication has preferentially operated on genes that have unusually high amounts of standing variation within wild populations.

Under the guidance of a mentor, this opportunity will involve: developing and applying methods in computational biology and artificial intelligence to gather information about gene function in the legume family; using the results to identify gene correspondences at several taxonomic levels – in particular, across genera, typically spanning several species of agronomic importance such as beans or chickpeas and also across the plant family as a whole; and to identify correspondences among agronomically important genes across many crop and model species in this large plant family. After identifying corresponding genes, genomic regions will be evaluated for features such as signatures of selection or diversifying or purifying selection, around genes and regions of agricultural importance.

Learning Objectives: The participant will learn and apply methods in computational biology, genetics, and artificial intelligence, including statistical methods of marker-trait association, methods for determining syntenic relationships and for calculating and representing pan-genome relationships, methods for inferring gene families, and methods for inferring evolutionary events from large collections of gene families. The participant will also have the opportunity to read, evaluate, and participate in writing scientific manuscripts in these areas of focus.

Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Steven Cannon (Steven.Cannon@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: March 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $5,185 - $6,273 monthly.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

These stressors act on cellular and molecular processes, but unlike in human and veterinary medicine, cell culture systems are largely underutilized in honey bee and other bee research to study the effects of stressors at a high level of resolution under controlled conditions. Although a continuous honey bee cell line exists, it is persistently infected with a honey bee virus. As an ORISE Postdoctoral Research Fellow, you will collaborate with a team of colleagues led by your mentor to establish virus-free primary cultures using tissues from bee pollinators of commercial importance, as well as from the mite, Varroa destructor, a widespread, often abundant parasite known to transmit honey bee viruses. Reproducible establishment of primary bee and mite parasite cultures will provide a powerful platform for cell-based studies examining host-pathogen and bee-agrichemical interactions and promote creation of innovations that mitigate negative outcomes from these relationships.

Learning Objectives: You will learn and apply skills in microbiology, virology, insect biology and beekeeping to explore host-virus interactions at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels and transfer this knowledge to impact the beekeeping industry.

Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Michael Goblirsch (Michael.Goblirsch@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: March 1, 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $75,000 - $90,000 annually.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

 *Applications may be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A postdoctoral research opportunity is available with the Tropical Crop and Commodity Protection Research Unit within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) located in Hilo, Hawaii.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

The mission of the Tropical Crop and Commodity Protection Research Unit in Hilo, Hawaii is to develop pre and postharvest technologies and management strategies for invasive pests, and to open and maintain market access and improved quality of tropical fruit, vegetable and ornamental crops grown in the Pacific Basin. The long-term goals of our research program are to develop and protect U.S export markets for fresh tropical commodities. An emphasis is placed on expanding and diversifying agriculture and agricultural exports in Hawaii and other states by providing environmentally sound, economically viable systems, treatments, or processes that control quarantine pests, ensure product quality, and increase product value while safeguarding the agriculture of other states.

Research Project: ‘Ulu (breadfruit) has significant cultural importance to Hawaiians and is one of the original staple crops that fed the island nation for close to 1,000 years with high starch, fiber, and protein contents. ‘Ulu also has a low to moderate glycemic index when cooked and can help manage blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Today, at nearly 2,500 miles from the US mainland, Hawaii imports greater than 85% of its food. Disruption to the supply chain can have catastrophic effects as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2020, food insecurity has dramatically increased among the Islands, encouraging the expansion of stable crops and processing capabilities that support the long-term storage and distribution of processed foods derived from these staple foods.

Much of Hawaii ‘ulu supply is sold as fresh produce. Mature ‘ulu, once picked, becomes soft within 1-3 days without refrigeration; the short shelf-life reduces profit margins, generates waste, limits its distribution and export opportunities. The ‘Ulu Cooperative, a collection of small, diversified ‘ulu producers, helped develop processes to produce ‘ulu flour in 2011 to increase its potential market and maximize the yield of ‘ulu. One of the biggest hurdles, however, to the processing of many of Hawaii’s crops is the lack of industrial scale facilities. With Hawaii having the highest electricity retail price at more than double the US average, the cost of large-scale processing is prohibitive. Presently, processing of ‘ulu relies on steamers and dehydrators, which are time consuming and do not produce the most consistent quality of end products. Improved processing methods are urgently needed to overcome the bottleneck of scaling up ‘ulu production, increase market distribution, reduce waste, and foster local economies. Specific activities will include maintaining and operating food processing equipment, experimental design, and nutritional and sensory analysis. Outcomes from this project will be useful to our 'ulu growers as well as other tropical commodities that are extremely perishable and in need of better processing methods.

Learning Objectives: The participant will learn how to incorporate their scientific and technical knowledge in the field of food science with food processing engineering to improve the processing capability for both research within ARS and the stakeholders in Hawaii. The participant will get to explore the possibility of incorporating sensors, spectroscopy, imaging, and machine learning techniques into the postharvest processing workflows and/or pre-harvest evaluation of food quality and safety. The participant will have the opportunity to interact with our commercial and academic collaborators, and present their research to a wide range of audiences in engineering and food science disciplines.

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Peishih Liang (peishih.liang@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: 2026.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full-time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience.

Description
 *Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), located in Raleigh, North Carolina.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: A key objective of the Circular Economy for Reimagining Maize Agriculture (CERCA) project supported by USDA-ARS is to develop corn varieties with reduced grain protein content coupled with high yield. This will help US farmers continue to produce corn grain efficiently for animal feed and industrial uses while reducing input costs associated with nitrogen fertilizer. Rather than extracting nitrogen from soil in the form of grain, a new approach to corn agriculture is to recycle nitrogen on-farm as much as possible to improve its profitability and sustainability. One strategy to achieve this goal is to reduce fertilizer inputs and select for new varieties that primarily remobilize nitrogen from senescing leaves to roots, stalks, or cobs rather than seeds.

The participant will help evaluate three generations of selection for reduced grain protein content that were performed independently at three locations (IA, MN, and MO) and in three populations by CERCA collaborators. In 2026 samples of the three starting populations, the most recent selected generations from each location, and control unselected generations will be planted in NC and in other CERCA cooperator locations. The participant will be involved in field experiments and controlled pollinations to produce research materials. The participant will measure grain protein content on 96 individual plants within each sub-population using near-infrared reflectance spectrophotometry. Grain protein content data of each population will be compared to measure the effectiveness of individual plant selection to reduce grain protein content.

The participant will also perform low coverage sequencing of each plant and manage bioinformatics pipelines for genomic data analysis.  Protein content data will be combined with genotype data to permit two tests of functional importance of each genetic variant: genome-wide association study and signals of selection due to allele frequency shifts under selection. Candidate genes identified by these approaches will be evaluated for involvement in biosynthesis and cellular localization of storage proteins. Genes identified in this way will represent targets for future gene editing to improve the rate of genetic improvement for reduced grain protein content. 

Learning Objectives: The candidate will learn about genetic analysis of complex phenotypes in crops and the use of genetics to understand and manipulate grain protein content.

The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

Research Project: This appointment is part of the Methods and Applications of Food Composition Laboratory effort improve the speed, accuracy, and/or sensitivity of methods for measuring nutrients in the foods Americans eat. Dietary fiber (DF) is the polymeric carbohydrate portion of plant-based foods not hydrolyzed by human digestive enzymes.  DF consumption has been linked to reduced plasma cholesterol concentration, improved glucose regulation, and decreased incidence of heart disease and colorectal cancer. Since 2005 the Dietary Guidelines for Americans have listed underconsumption of DF as a public health concern, however changes the definition of DF have resulted in a complicated and costly process for measuring DF content in foods. The goal of this project is to reduce the cost of dietary fiber analysis. The development of a simplified method for DF determination and adoption by professional organizations such as the AOAC or Cereals & Grains (formerly AACC) would benefit

The fellow will learn how to generate an instrumental method for soluble dietary fiber analysis, along with exemplar data sufficient to initiate an interlaboratory study, which is required for AOAC and AACC approval.  Samples of beans (Great Northern and black), cereal grains (whole wheat and rice), ancient grains (sorghum and spelt), pseudocereals (amaranth and buckwheat), and traditional foods with novel carbohydrate components such as algae (nori and kombu) will be commercially obtained.  Lyophilized, ground, food samples will be digested and under the biomimetic conditions of AOAC 2022.01 in tared digestion tubes, however after digestion, IDF will be isolated by centrifugation.  Bypassing precipitation, proteinaceous and mineral components will be removed from the supernatant using ion exchange resins. The supernatant will be lyophilized and reconstituted at several levels of dilution to optimize method selectivity and sensitivity. Each level will receive the internal standard, diethyleneglycol, and be analyzed by size exclusion chromatography followed by RI detection and universal mass calibration will be performed by viscometry.    As a universal detector, RI allows for absolute quantitation of soluble dietary fiber with no need for ash or nitrogen correction, saving time and reducing cost. Universal mass calibration will offer true molecular weight data for soluble fiber composition.  These data will be published in an AOAC or AACC journal, and a potential interlaboratory study.

Learning Objectives: As a result of this training, the participant will gain knowledge and experience in:

Enzymatic, chromatographic and related methods for the analysis of dietary fiber and other carbohydrates.
Analytical method validation, including assessment of analytical figures of merit, robustness, and method detection limits.
Statistical methods used to evaluate assay variability in nutrition science.

The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

The mission of our research is to improve food safety and reduce foodborne illness by examining routes of contamination of fruits and vegetables with bacterial pathogens.

Research Project: The research project is focused on critical points of bacterial contamination, specifically colonization of dairy animals and contamination of dry dairy processing facilities. The participant will have the opportunity to investigate pathogen dynamics in dry dairy products within an integrated food safety systems framework. Specifically, the research focuses on high-risk bacterial pathogens: Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli (STECs/O157:H7), and Listeria monocytogenes. This includes characterizing pathogenic enteric bacteria on dairy farms, their ecology, and routes of transmission within the dairy herd and to milk. Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will examine specific production environments that support bacterial pathogen survival under a variety of non-optimal growth conditions. The core research quantifies pathogen survival, competitive persistence, and niche establishment. The microbial community dynamics, specifically the interaction and competition between saprophytic vs. pathogenic enteric bacteria, will be quantified to understand their influence on long-term pathogen persistence and levels. Under guidance of the mentor, the participant will be part of all aspects of the experiment, from laboratory studies to field investigations, utilizing methodology and protocols including digital PCR (dPCR), multiplex PCR, automated nucleic acid extraction, and microbial community analysis (metagenomics/bioinformatics). The participant will also have the opportunity to be involved in the design and validation of novel, science-based interventions—such as biological controls using plant-derived bioactive compounds—to reduce pathogenic bacterial loads and mitigate virulence across the dairy supply chain. The participant will also learn about statistical analysis of data in consultation with ARS colleagues.  

Learning Objectives: Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will gain expertise in three core areas essential to modern integrated agricultural safety research focused on bacterial pathogens:

Bacterial Hazard Characterization and Quantification: Learn advanced molecular and non-destructive sensing methods to identify, quantify, and track the prevalence and spatial dissemination of pathogenic enteric bacteria (e.g., Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria) across dairy-related matrices (manure, water, milk contact surfaces).
Persistence Modeling and Risk Assessment: Develop complex ecological and kinetic models incorporating environmental, microbial community, and survival data to predict the likelihood and extent of bacterial contaminant introduction, persistence, and transfer in the dairy system.
Intervention Strategy Development and Optimization: Utilize advanced data analysis tools, including bioinformatics and introductory data science skills, to inform, design, and validate effective, science-based mitigation strategies, thereby optimizing production and processing guidelines for reducing pathogenic bacterial levels.  
The participant will learn methods to quantify and/or determine the prevalence of bacterial pathogen loads, including Digital PCR techniques and automated nucleic acid extraction techniques, microbial community analysis, and introductory data science skills. The participant will have the opportunity to learn more in-depth statistical analysis techniques or molecular biology tools through various trainings and workshops if desired, and also through collaboration on interdisciplinary projects within ARS. The participant will have the opportunity to present data/findings at international scientific meetings related to food safety / environmental microbiology, and regional (U.S. Mid-Atlantic region) meetings as well. USDA ARS EMFSL is located in the metro-Washington, D.C. area at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC), which provides ample interaction with ARS scientists as well as with other government research scientists and policymakers at regulatory agencies in private industry. EMFSL has a strong history of collaborating with many different academic institutions, U.S. federal government agencies on large field- and laboratory-based research, and private industry and stakeholder research projects. ORISE fellows, post-doctoral research associates and interns who have previously been at EMFSL have had success in using their experience to gain different opportunities at the state and federal government levels, and with trade associations and in private industry.

Mentor(s): The mentors for this opportunity are Manan Sharma (manan.sharma@usda.gov) and Bradd Haley (bradd.haley@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: 2025/2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $6,277 - $6,897 monthly.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

Description
 *Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Southwest Research Station (PSWRS) located in Davis, California.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: A legacy of fire exclusion and past management in our Western U.S. Forests, coupled with rapid changes in climate, have led to dramatically more frequent and large-magnitude disturbances, including massive, high-severity stand-replacing fires. The increasing scale and severity of disturbances affects forest successional trajectories and in turn presents a challenge for forest managers to meet economic and forest recovery goals. The goal of the current research project is to quantify change in forest habitat following large-scale fires in California, Oregon, and Washington to better understand where managers most need to apply fire and fuels treatments, promote future forests, and protect the remaining high-value forest refugia necessary for the persistence of key wildlife species. Currently, this project has collected data across 7 wildfires including data on stand structure and condition, understory cover and species composition, the spread of invasive plant species, and use by wildlife species. This data was collected primarily in upland habitats, but a subset of the data focuses on changes in meadows over time.

Learning Objectives: The selected fellow(s) in this project will have the opportunity to contribute and advance their knowledge and skills in forest and meadow ecology, disturbance ecology and wildlife research that can inform natural resource management. The fellow(s) will interact with a variety of forests managers, and a team of research staff, including leading scientists in the fields of forestry and wildlife management. The fellow(s) will have the opportunity to enhance their communications skills via participating in various formal and informal meetings, learning new quantitative techniques, and writing of manuscripts and reports for possible publication. 

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Angela White (angela.white2@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: February 2026.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year and ten months (22 months total) but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $4,500 - $6,500 monthly.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service.

ROJECT TITLE: Pinyon Jay response to juniper management, Deschutes County, Oregon.

BACKGROUND: Pinyon Jays (PIJA, Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) have experienced significant, range-wide declines over the past 50 years, and are currently under Status Review for ESA listing. Deschutes County, Oregon represents the northwestern-most extent of the species range and lies far outside the extant range of pinyon pine species. Extensive treatments of juniper woodlands have been expedited throughout western states for restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, sage grouse habitat, and altered fire regimes. However, we lack clear understanding of how these treatments impact PIJA populations.  

Management priorities for PIJA in Oregon include assessing impacts of juniper treatments on PIJA and determining state-wide distribution. The primary goals of this project are to experimentally study how juniper treatments impact occupancy, habitat use, and nesting of PIJA on BLM lands in Deschutes County, Oregon. We are implementing a before-after-control-impact study and use bioacoustics monitoring, point counts, and nest searching methods. The MS project will focus on at least one component of the project. This work is in partnership with the East Cascades Bird Alliance, US Fish and Wildlife, and Deschutes BLM. We also contribute to the PIJA Western Working Group and the PIJA Conservation Action Strategy (CAS). The MS candidate will be expected to coordinate with and contribute findings to larger range-wide intiatives. 

LOCATION & PROGRAM: This position supports a student in the Masters of Science in Natural Resources at Oregon Tech in Klamath Falls, OR. Our MS program started in 2024 and is in the Natural Sciences Department, which also encompasses the MS of Medical Science program, and BS programs in Environmental Science and Biology-Health Science. Program description and requirements are here https://www.oit.edu/academics/degrees/natural-resources 

SUPPORT: This position includes the opportunity for a Graduate Teaching Assistantship for the Academic Years 2026-2026 and 2027-2028. The GTA will teach labs in the 200-level Principles of Biology series for majors, &/or similar courses within the students expertise. GTAs cover two 3-hour sections per term. Oregon Tech is on a quarter system. Fall, Winter, and Spring terms are 11 weeks. Our academic year runs from mid-September to Mid-June.  The GTA provides a per-term stipend and partial tuition remission during the academic year (Fall through Spring terms). In addition, this research assistantship will provide additional part-time stipend during the spring term, and full-time hourly salary over the summer. Some travel costs from Klamath Falls to Bend, OR will be covered. The graduate student will be expected to use their own vehicle, preferably one that can handle rugged, rocky roads to access field sites. If the student would prefer to forgo the GTA position and cover their own academic costs, that would be an option. 

POSITION REQUIREMENTS: The candidate should have a Bachelors degree in Natural Resources, Wildlife, Ecology, Environmental Science or a closely related program of study and should meet the requirements for acceptance into the Masters of Natural Resources program at Oregon Tech. Ideally, the applicant will have at least 2 years of field experience studying birds, particularly nest searching and point counts. Experience with bioacoustics monitoring (ARUs, BirdNET) will be especially helpful. Additionally, experience doing habitat analyses (Occupancy modeling, RSFs, SDMs) using program R and GIS will be very valuable.  The candidate should have proven ability to work independently in remote areas, and as a member of a team, including supervising undergraduates and working with volunteers. 

 

DATES: Start date is flexible. We are beginning the greater project design and implementation this winter 2026, therefore, the candidate could start as early as March, 2026 as a temporary hire. The academic year begins in mid-September, 2026. 

LOCATION: Oregon Tech is in Klamath Falls, OR, a small rural region of south-central Oregon. The field research about 3 hours north, near Bend and Sisters, Oregon in the east Cascades, sage-steppe biome.

Description
The Division of Forestry and Natural Resources at West Virginia University is searching for a Ph.D. student to monitor Ruffed Grouse populations, in response to different landscape contexts and disturbances, including varying levels of timber harvests, prescribed fire, and cut-back borders. The students will use Autonomous Recording Units (ARUs) and spring drumming counts to determine occupancy and abundance of Ruffed Grouse. The students will also be responsible for sampling mosquitoes for West Nile Virus. Finally, the students will collect data about other breeding birds utilizing young forests, and vegetation structure data.

This project will occur across West Virginia on private and public lands. Ruffed Grouse and bird utilizing young forests have declined precipitously, and the goal of this project is to identify landscape scale management strategies to improve populations via occupancy or abundance. Additionally, West Nile Virus could be a contributing factor in Ruffed Grouse declines, and in West Virginia there are no data about the distribution and prevalence of the virus or mosquitoes. The students will also have opportunities and flexibility to develop and design additional research projects if they are within the scope of the main project questions. Some songbird species that could respond to management include Golden-winged warbler, Prairie warbler, and Yellow-breasted chat. 

The project will occur on multiple state wildlife management areas, state forests, and on Weyerhaeuser property. There will be significant traveling and potential for camping or living in rustic state field houses. The students should also have experience driving on gravel or dirt roads and with 4x4 vehicles. The data collection will begin in April and continue into August. Students should expect to be flexible with scheduling and work together to coordinate data collection schedules. Results should inform landscape level planning and management strategies for Ruffed Grouse and other young forest species. The research is funded through the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources, Ruffed Grouse Society, and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. 

The student will be working towards a Ph.D. Wildlife and Fisheries Resources at West Virginia University. STARTING DATE: May 2026. The ideal applicant should have experience with ARUs and analyzing acoustic data, must be able to identify central Appalachian avian species by sight and by sound and have experience conducting point count surveys, and some experience with insect sampling and mosquito identification. Applicants should also be familiar with collecting structural habitat measurements including but not limited to; DBH, canopy cover (using spherical densitometers), Robel pole, Daubenmire frame, etc. Applicants should be comfortable working long days in the field during hot summer months, ready to travel, and energetic and excited about applied avian conservation research. Applicants will also be responsible for hiring and supervising research technicians to assist with research duties. Applicants must have completed a BS and MS in Wildlife Biology, Ecology, or a closely related field. Applicants with peer-reviewed publications are preferred. Applicants must have a minimum of 300 combined GRE score (V+Q) or 1100 on the previous scale, and a minimum 3.25 GPA. To Apply: Electronic applications are preferred. To apply send a single file including: 1) a cover letter outlining any relevant work experiences with Ruffed Grouse, ARUs and acoustic monitoring, avian point counts, mosquito/invertebrate sampling and identification, 2) resumé including an unofficial copy of transcripts and GRE scores, and 3) contact information for 3 references to Dr. Chris Lituma; cml0017@mail.wvu.edu

 Title: Graduate Research Assistant – M.Sc. in Forest Recourses, emphasis in Wildlife Management 
Affiliation: Snowden Waterfowl Center of Excellence, University of Arkansas at Monticello 
Location: Monticello, Arkansas 
Start date: May or August 2026 
Available funding – up to 3 years 
 Position Description: The Snowden Waterfowl Center of Excellence within the College of forestry, Agriculture, and Natural Resources at the University of Arkansas at Monticello is recruiting applicants for the position of Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) to pursue a Master’s of Science (M.Sc.) degree in Forest Resources studying the spatial arrangement of habitat components including bottomland hardwood reforestation on habitat suitability for midcontinent mallards. Specific aspects of the study will include the construction of a user-friendly, ArcGIS online decision support tool for prioritizing areas for reforestation that will maximize co-benefits for waterfowl. The position carries an annual stipend of $20,000 plus tuition waiver. Expected start date of May or August 2026. 
 Project Description: Bottomland hardwood forests are under extreme and accelerated pressure from anthropogenic and environmental stressors, subsequently impact many ecological processes including the degradation of habitat quality for forested wetland dependent waterfowl. The extent of historical loss from drainage and agricultural conversion; degradation of forest health from insects and disease; shifts in tree species composition from water stress, and excessive declines in abundance of wintering waterfowl in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley are overwhelmingly documented. Thus, restoration and reforestation effects are of utmost priority in the region and newly emerging carbon credit markets may provide the catalyst needed to accelerate reforestation in the region to improve habitat suitability for wintering mallards. The purpose of this project is to provide guidance for carbon-based reforestation efforts to maximize the co-benefits for waterfowl.   
 Requirements: Applicants must have a 2.7 overall undergraduate GPA or 3.0 GPA in the last 60 semester hours of undergraduate courses. Also required a B.S. degree in geospatial sciences, geography, wildlife management/conservation, or related field, while experiences with waterfowl, GIS, remote sensing, data science, and landscape ecology are preferred. Applicants must have a valid U.S. driver’s license or obtain the same within 60 days of starting employment. Overnight travel and fall/winter field work are required as well as the ability to work outdoors in all weather conditions. 
 Location and Facilities: The Snowden Waterfowl Center of Excellence is housed within the College of Forestry, Agriculture & Natural Resources at the University of Arkansas at Monticello, in southeastern Arkansas. Graduate students will have a designated office space and computer, and will work alongside faculty, staff, and other graduate students within the Snowden Waterfowl Center and College of Forestry, Agriculture & Natural Resources.

Description
Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center is seeking 1 student contractor technician for the 2026 summer field season for research on the Dakota skipper, a Federally listed butterfly. Research will focus on questions concerning site occupancy and skipper detectability. The technician will be responsible for surveying for Dakota skippers and performing vegetation surveys in grassland sites in North and/or South Dakota, exact location(s) TBD. The technician will be trained in data-collection methods at the beginning of the field season. Skipper surveys will mostly occur in June and July while vegetation surveys at the same sites will occur in August. Start date is somewhat flexible centered around mid-May, while the end date is also likely flexible (~ end of August).

Field work is extensive and requires long hours walking in prairie sites, in uneven terrain and off trail, sometimes in challenging weather conditions. Field work will involve exposure to a wide variety of weather conditions including cold, mud, intense heat, and humidity. Exposure to biting insects and ticks is possible. At the end of each field day, when out of the field, the technician will likely be expected to do data entry/management tasks. Housing will be provided and is likely to be in campers, and it is possible that technicians will be asked to move housing (camper) locations during the field season. For this reason, trailering experience or experience living in and maintaining campers would be considered a bonus, but is not required for the position.

This position is only open to students or recent graduates (graduated less than 1 year from start date)
(Ex. If graduated in June 2025, you qualify for our start date in mid-May 2026). Interested applicants should submit an updated resume, a recent copy of their academic transcripts, and a copy of diploma if applicable. Selections may be made as resumes come in.

Start Date: mid-May 2026 but somewhat flexible

This is a 9-month tenure-accruing position that will be 70% research (Florida Agricultural Experiment Station) and 30% extension (Florida Cooperative Extension Service), available at the Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center, Davie, FL, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, at the University of Florida.  Tenure will accrue in the Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation. This assignment may change in accordance with the needs of the unit. 
 Duties will include development of a productive, interdisciplinary, extramurally funded research program in the field of invasive wildlife ecology with a focus on providing natural resource managers, private landowners, and other stakeholders with scientific information to contribute to development of effective data-driven control strategies for invasive wildlife that threaten ecosystem health and economic sustainability. In addition, this program will provide baseline data to determine impacts of invasive wildlife species on native fauna and ecosystems, agricultural production, and the built environment's infrastructure. This may include, but is not limited to, application of field-based approaches, statistical modeling, artificial intelligence/machine learning, and molecular techniques aimed to identify impacts and to improve detection, removal, and monitoring of invasive wildlife. As an interdisciplinary field, invasion ecology affords many opportunities for internal and external collaborations, and the candidate is encouraged to seek collaborations with established research programs at UF/IFAS, other academic institutions, and government agencies. 
 Extension responsibilities may include developing educational programs and toolkits on detecting, reporting, and controlling invasive wildlife species. The incumbent will provide proactive leadership, training, and assistance to UF and other stakeholders. Interaction with local, state, and federal agencies as well as Indian tribes will be important to this position. The faculty member will actively participate in graduate education by chairing graduate committees, serving on graduate committees, supervising thesis and dissertation research, and publishing the results with their graduate students. Faculty are encouraged to participate in professional development activities related to teaching and advising and may teach courses and seminars. The faculty member will actively seek extramural funding to support their program, publish in referred journals, and produce extension publications. The faculty member is expected to engage in extension activities in their program area.
 Because of the IFAS land-grant mission, all faculty are expected to be supportive of and engaged in all three mission areas—Research, Teaching and Extension—regardless of the assignment split specified in the position description.

Start Date: May or September 2026                                           Location: Prince George, BC

Project Overview

This collaborative project with the British Columbia Ministry of Forests examines how interacting disturbances and climate change are reshaping forest trajectories in northern British Columbia. Focusing on landscapes affected by windthrow, insect outbreaks, and wildfire, the research aims to understand how disturbance severity and legacy effects influence long-term forest resilience.

The MSc student will investigate how disturbance legacies shape regeneration, stand structure, tree growth, and carbon dynamics using a combination of field-based forest surveys, dendrochronology (tree growth analysis), and geospatial tools, including drone-based lidar and satellite remote sensing. The project integrates ecological theory with applied management questions, providing hands-on experience in field ecology, quantitative analysis, and multi-scale disturbance assessment.

Qualifications

·        BSc (or expected completion) in forestry, ecology, environmental science, geography, or related field

·        Interest in forest disturbance ecology and climate change

·        Experience with fieldwork in forest ecosystems

·        Strong quantitative skills (R preferred)

·        Experience with GIS or remote sensing is an asset

·       Willingness to work in remote field conditions

Funding

Funding is anticipated at $20,000 for two years, subject to final confirmation. The student will also be encouraged to apply for scholarships (e.g., NSERC CGS-M, UNBC internal scholarships) and teaching assistantships.

Why UNBC?

UNBC is located in Prince George, the hub of northern British Columbia, offering direct access to diverse forest ecosystems shaped by multiple disturbance regimes. The university is recognized for its strengths in natural resources, forestry, and environmental science. Students benefit from small graduate cohorts, close faculty mentorship, and extensive hands-on field experience.

Description
Position Description: 
Our research team is dedicated to studying major international quarantine pests and invasive forest species, achieving several innovative breakthroughs. We are recruiting one M.S. student/one Ph.D. student with interests in biological invasions and quarantine, biodiversity conservation, and forest pest monitoring to join us.
In our research on the spongy moth, we have used molecular markers and morphological studies to confirm, for the first time, the invasion of the European spongy moth in China. We also established a tracing system for spongy moths, advancing international pest tracking and tracing technologies. In the field of forestry invasive species, we identified the pine wood nematode’s northward spread across the Yangtze River, studied the distribution and spread of multiple invasive species, developed molecular diagnostic tools, proposed monitoring, and control strategies for European woodwasp, and effectively reduced infestation rates. In pest risk analysis, we were the first in China to build a quantitative pest risk analysis system supported by @risk software. We utilized climate models to predict potential suitable habitats for invasive species, thereby strengthening biosecurity management.
If you are eager to contribute meaningfully to national and international forest biosecurity, we welcome your application. The candidates may have the opportunity to develop additional research questions that align with the research goals, and the students will be supervised by Prof. Juan Shi.

Title: Evaluating models to estimate Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) state and infection stage from antemortem tissues samples 

Description: 
The research associate/postdoc will work as part of an interdisciplinary team on a USDA–APHIS-funded project, that aims to (1) evaluate the limitations and potential inaccuracies of existing occupancy models that estimate CWD population prevalence and individual infection stage using multiple antemortem tissue samples and lab tests and (2) develop new approaches via sampling design, subsequent laboratory detection methods, and data analysis to reduce or eliminate inaccuracies, while accounting for expected tissue- and test-specific differences in sensitivity and specificity that likely vary among cervid species.

 We seek a research associate/postdoc with good quantitative skills, a background in disease ecology (preferably CWD or related diseases), and an ability to communicate and collaborate well with a diversity of partners. The research associate/postdoc will review information on existing methods to estimate CWD disease state and infection stage and use simulation to determine potential inaccuracies of these methods with likely dependencies among tissues and imperfect sensitivity and specificity of various lab tests. The research associate/postdoc will develop new approaches via sampling design, subsequent laboratory detection methods, and data analysis to reduce or eliminate inaccuracies, while accounting for expected tissue- and test-specific differences in sensitivity and specificity that likely vary among cervid species. Using this information, they will evaluate sampling design trade-offs and determine optimal sampling and testing strategies to meet common objectives for CWD studies of wild cervid populations, and potentially captive populations.
 
 The research associate/postdoc will have opportunities to work locally with collaborators at USDA National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) and collaborating state agencies (e.g., Nebraska Game and Parks). The research associate/postdoc will work closely with this team of quantitative ecologists and disease ecologists to develop Bayesian approaches to estimate conditional probabilities of disease state and infection status using multiple tissue types and laboratory assays with false positive and false-negative errors. Findings from this work will inform future study design, data collection, and use of laboratory test results for various scientific and management objectives.
 Minimum Qualifications:
Applicants must have a Masters, PhD, or equivalent degree in Quantitative Ecology/Biology, Disease Ecology/ Epidemiology, Statistics, or closely related field at time of hire.
2+ years of experience post-masters employment working with various state or federal agencies using simulation and subsequent statistical models (e.g., occupancy models) to evaluate model performance.
Demonstrated experience publishing scientific papers in one or more of the above fields.
Must be legally authorized to work in the United States by position start date. CSU will not provide a visa.
 Preferred Qualifications:
PhD, or equivalent degree in Quantitative Ecology/Biology, Disease Ecology/ Epidemiology, Statistics, or closely related field at time of hire.
Strong quantitative skills and occupancy-related analysis; experience evaluating statistical models via simulation.
Knowledge or experience in disease ecology demonstrated in submitted application materials.
Experience publishing scientific papers associated with your work.

Description
Overview

The Department of Wildland Resources at Utah State University seeks applicants for a full-time, nine-month tenure track faculty position as an Assistant Professor in Wildlife Ecology and Management. We are seeking a scholar dedicated to educating undergraduate students in wildlife science and related natural resource fields. The position will be 90% teaching and 10% service, and will be located at Utah State University’s Uintah Basin Regional Campus located in Vernal, Utah. The anticipated (negotiable) start date is August 1, 2026.
 The incumbent will be a member of USU’s Department of Wildland Resources (WILD), which is part of the S.J. and Jessie E. Quinney College of Agriculture & Natural Resources. WILD is home to the Berryman Institute, which is dedicated to improving human-wildlife interactions, and is the administrative home of the Utah USGS Cooperative Fish & Wildlife Research Unit. The department collaborates closely with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, the USDA-APHIS National Wildlife Research Center’s Utah Station, USU’s Ecology Center, and other agencies and organizations.

Responsibilities

The incumbent will teach a variety of wildlife science courses. Courses taught are expected to be mostly at the undergraduate level, but graduate courses may occasionally be needed. Courses may be taught face-to-face, online, broadcast, or in a hybrid format. Courses will primarily serve students living and working in the Uintah Basin campus, but some courses will also serve students at USU’s main campus in Logan. The candidate will coordinate course offerings with faculty at the USU Eastern campus in Price, Utah, where our Wildlife Ecology & Management degree is also offered. If desired, it may be possible to teach classes in the summer for additional compensation.
 The successful candidate will serve as the department's representative at the Uintah Basin Regional Campus, teaching, coordinating, and advocating for our Wildlife Ecology & Management major and Wildlife Science minor, while also contributing to our other programs as needed. This individual will mentor and advise undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. They will interact with administrators, faculty, staff, and others at their home campus in Vernal, with our faculty member at USU Eastern in Price, and at the main campus in Logan to continue our established and successful program by coordinating the provision of courses needed by local students and coordinating the financial, scholarship, and other resources available for the wildlife program and other programs in the Uintah Basin. They will maintain and cultivate existing contacts with local offices of land management agencies such as the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, for enrichment activities like field trips for students, for possible internships while the students are in school, and eventually for career positions for graduates.
 Although research is not officially part of this position, some research opportunities exist, particularly by working with the local land management agencies and during the summer. If desired, and if funding is available, the candidate may advise a graduate student. The candidate may serve on graduate student committees.

Since 1998, more than 175,000 students from diverse communities and backgrounds have participated in our programs to discover, learn,
explore, and reflect on the science and wonder of nature. For many, Dunes Learning Center is the gateway to Indiana Dunes National Park
and the beginning of their environmental science education. These experiences support students on the pathway to science-based
careers, inspiring the next generation of scientists, environmental advocates, and educators.
Looking back on 25 years of exploration and investigation in nature's classroom, Dunes Learning Center is proud to be at the forefront of
environmental education in the Indiana Dunes. We serve a diverse community and seek a diverse workforce. Dunes Learning Center is an
equal opportunity provider and does not discriminate.

SUMMARY
Dunes Learning Center is proud to carry on a tradition of learning in the dunes that dates back more than 100 years ago by the “Father of
Ecology in North America,” Dr. Henry Chandler Cowles. Our programs provide a critical and beneficial connection to nature for learners of
all ages—inspiring curiosity, scientific literacy, and environmental stewardship.
Outreach Education Fellows are key members of the Dunes Learning Center team who deliver programs online, in schools, and natural
areas providing meaningful experiences to over 5,000 students in Northwest Indiana. They help students create connections, build
confidence, and develop a sense of place by providing opportunities to explore, ask questions, reflect and work together as a team.
Our Outreach Education Fellowship provides an opportunity for next generation leaders to receive training and coaching to develop their
naturalist, outdoor education, and resource interpretation skills and techniques. Fellows work both as a team and independently to lead a
variety of programs to a wide audience in diverse settings, often working closely with public school systems and partners throughout the
year. In the summer, the outreach team leads day-camps based at Indiana Dunes National Park’s historic Chellberg Farm and assists with
residential camps. Outreach Education Fellows have opportunities to extend their professional development through workshops,
in-services, and networking.

Description
 *Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNWRS) located in Seattle, Washington.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: Weather is a critical element in wildland fire, driving both fire behavior and smoke dispersion. These are issues for both wildfires and prescribed fires, and the needs for the two types of fires, and the two areas of impact, are very different. While smoke and fire behavior are traditionally studied separately, they are closely related through fire intensity, consumption, buoyancy fluxes, etc. Prescribed fires are intentionally executed to achieve specific goals, and the intent and goals lead to constraints that either don’t exist, or cannot be selected/managed during wildfires. 

We are looking for a fellow to engage in research and tool development that addresses atmospheric influences on lower intensity fires, more typical of prescribed fires than wildfires. The area of research is broadly defined, allowing a significant degree of flexibility. It can include, for example: 

understanding the relationship between atmospheric model output and on-the-ground weather at the earth’s surface; 
measurement techniques for fire behavior, smoke lofting, turbulence, and other in situ properties; 
remote sensing of fire behavior using UAS, satellites, or acoustics; 
development of educational materials to communicate the state of fire weather science to fuel managers and fire fighters.
Regardless of the specific focus, the research highly recommends the ability to employ the fundamental physics of fluid dynamics to develop novel statistical techniques, analyze satellite and other remote sensing data, implement machine learning algorithms, assess numerical model performance, improve risk assessment tools, and deepen our understanding of fire and smoke as ecological processes.

Learning Objectives: The fellow will collaborate with leading experts in fire meteorology and smoke transport and dispersion. The fellowship provides excellent opportunities to learn about interactions between the planetary boundary layer, complex terrain, and mixing processes involved in smoke and fire. The breadth of techniques and skills used in fire/smoke-atmosphere interactions research guarantees that whatever skills the fellow starts with, there are other skills they will add to their portfolio. The team’s regular interactions with land management and air quality management practitioners provide an unparalleled opportunity to understand the application needs that drive the research questions of greatest potential impact.

Mentor: The mentors for this opportunity are Susan O'Neill (susan.oneill1@usda.gov), Brian Potter (brian.potter@usda.gov), and Joseph Charney (joseph.j.charney@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: January/February 2026.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be up to one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $70,000 - $90,000 annually.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Questions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email ORISE.USFS.PNWRS@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.

Description
 Position Overview:
The Cedar Creek LTER (Long Term Ecological Research Network) has several opportunities for students to work as plant community ecology interns. Most positions run from June through August, but some interns are needed as early as March, and some are needed through October. Your educational institution may be able to approve this internship for any field biology requirement of your major. As a research intern, you will contribute to ongoing field experiments, attend scientific seminars, and interact with professors, post-docs, and graduate students. If you are an undergraduate or a newly graduated student with a background or interest in biology, ecology, environmental science, botany, environmental education, or related field we encourage you to apply.

Pay is $15.50 per hour. Typical workdays are eight hours Monday through Friday; however, some projects require weekend, early morning, and evening work. Most of the work you do will be out in the field, though a few jobs have indoor laboratory or computer components. On-site dormitory housing is available to rent.

Research Overview:
We have two large scale projects, a new experiment, and several other LTER projects sampling across experimental platforms that interns will be working on for the season. BioCON is one of the large-scale experiments where we explore the ways in which plant communities respond to environmental changes such as increased nitrogen deposition, increased atmospheric CO2, decreased biodiversity, altered precipitation patterns, and increased temperatures. Another large-scale project is the Big Biodiversity experiment that studies how plant biodiversity affects the rates, dynamics, and stability of ecological processes at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. The new WEM experiment will be set up during the field season and will be looking at changes in precipitation, species establishment, and removal of certain consumer groups. Throughout the summer we will maintain and sample these experiments. 

Professional Development Opportunities:
As part of these positions, you may have the opportunity to work with researchers in a more in depth manner regarding experimental processes. There will also be an opening research symposium as well as seminars led by researchers on a variety of topics during the summer. 

REU (Research Experience for Undergrads) Opportunities
Cedar Creek LTER also has multiple REU opportunities for the summer. These opportunities are open to undergraduate students that have not yet graduated (enrolled for fall 2026 classes). The pay rate is in stipend form and is comparable to the internship pay rate. These REU positions will focus on sampling across the LTER experimental platforms at Cedar Creek. 


Research site:
CCESR is an eight square mile tract of land 35 miles north of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul (MN). Cedar Creek is endowed with a mosaic of prairie, savanna, sedge meadows, bogs, open water, forests, and even abandoned agricultural fields. Its large size, great natural biodiversity, and uniform soil substrate make it ideal for ecosystem studies. 


Qualifications:

Ability to work outdoors.
Effective analytical and communication skills.
Strong organizational and time management skills.
End date must be later than August 14th.
Driver’s license is preferred but not required.

To apply for the intern position please visit our website, z.umn.edu/cdrjobs. The deadline for application submission is February 17th. For those interested in a spring position, please apply by February 9th. For any questions regarding the internships or application please email ccintern@umn.edu or call 612-301-2616.

MS position –Coyote behavioral ecology and nest depredation in coastal North Carolina 
 The Applied Conservation Lab in the Department of Biological Sciences at Marshall University is recruiting a graduate student (M.S.) to participate in a behavioral ecology study on Coyotes in coastal North Carolina at the Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune (Jacksonville, NC). The study will use GPS telemetry, field observations, and remote videography in an adaptive framework to examine coyote predation in coastal habitats. 
 TIMELINE: The position is available starting January 2026 but may start May 2026. 
 FUNDING: Funding will consist of a combination of research and teaching assistantships for two years. A 12-month competitive stipend ($18,000), and full tuition waiver will be provided. The student is responsible for covering University fees. The funded position requires a 2.5-3 yr commitment, with the successful applicant starting field work in summer 2026. The student will work under the mentorship of Dr. Shane Welch and will spend ~8 months per year in the field (including summer and 1 semester/year). While on campus (1 semester/year; Huntington, WV), the student will be expected to teach biology labs in Biological Sciences as a Graduate Teaching Assistant. The student will be expected to manage and train field technicians, as needed. 
 Salary and compensation: ~$18,000/year plus a tuition waiver (excluding fees). Because the position requires use of personal vehicle, we will compensate for mileage accrued at the study site @ $0.55/mile. Field housing is provided approximately 30 minutes from the study site, and the student is required to share utility costs with housemates. 
 We are seeking a highly motivated student with prior field experience (preferably mammal-focused) and an interest in behavioral ecology and spatial modeling. The applicant must be adaptable, tolerant of uncomfortable field conditions (hot, high humidity, biting insects), and work well with others (peers and technicians). 
 Send application materials, including unofficial transcripts, resume with contact information for three references, and a 1-page statement of interest to Dr. Shane Welch (welchsh@marshall.edu). We will begin reviewing applications immediately and the position will remain open until filled.

Undergraduate Opportunities
Description
The Hubbard Brook Research Foundation, with funding from the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program, anticipates openings for students in the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program during the summer of 2026. One of those openings will be devoted to assisting with the long-term monitoring of forest insects present in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF). 

Students will work with research teams involving other undergraduate and graduate students, studying the biota and ecology of HBEF. The REU students will develop and conduct an independent research project under the supervision of their mentor. Many REU students continue their work as an independent study or senior honors thesis at their home institution. Additionally, through weekly on-site presentations given by the mentors and other scientists, students are also exposed to a full spectrum of ecosystem research at Hubbard Brook. The program runs from late May to mid-August. Students receive a stipend of $5500 for the 10-week program, as well as housing. Limited funding is available for research supplies and travel expenses. Students live at HBRF’s researcher housing adjacent to HBEF, among a community of summer field students and technicians. All residents are expected to share and cooperate with cleaning, cooking, and related chores.
 Lepidoptera / Forest insect community: This project aims to understand more about the Lepidoptera (moths and caterpillars) community, the most important herbivores in northern hardwood forests and a critical link from plant production to consumers like birds and bats. We will work with the insect-REU student to develop a project that may include elements such as building a photographic library of the moths and caterpillars within Hubbard Brook, collecting forest insect samples using various field methods, developing both manual and AI-assisted methods for identifying and enumerating moths (and other insect orders), as well as other research avenues to be determined by the student and mentors. Due to the Lepidoptera and forest insect work being closely linked to bird and bat research, the student will learn and participate in long-term bird research including nest searching and counting food availability, as well as participate in bat research and bioacoustics monitoring. Through this opportunity, the student will have ample access to a multitude of research questions to explore and a chance to contribute to new knowledge in forest ecosystem dynamics.
 In your application, please include: a letter explaining why a summer research project interests you and how it fits into your broader plans, your resume and email contact for two references (they do not need to submit letters). Applications are due by March 6.

If interested in the position, please send your application to Dr. Matt Ayres (Dartmouth College: matthew.p.ayres@dartmouth.edu) and Jessica Jones (Dartmouth College: jessica.s.jones.gr@dartmouth.edu).

The Human-Wildlife Interactions Lab at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is hiring one technician for the summer of 2026 to work on a project studying the Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis).  The project will examine foraging and roosting behavior using radio telemetry, acoustic monitoring, insect sampling, and roost counts in a landscape with a mosaic of different land uses. Technicians will gain valuable experience with a federally endangered bat species and an understanding of its ecology in human altered landscapes.

The technician will be assisting one graduate student with thesis research. Work hours will be flexible and irregular as the needs of the project and division of labor dictate and will include significant nocturnal and weekend hours. The project will provide housing shared by the technicians and graduate student.

To apply, please send a cover letter, CV or resume, and contact information for two or three references. Your cover letter should address your interest in working on the project, relevant experiences, and the personal characteristics the work requires. Please send the application materials in one pdf to Matthew Zianni at mzianni2@illinois.edu with “SODALIS bat technician” in the subject. Applications will be reviewed as they are submitted.

Responsibilities

-          Radio Telemetry: Track individual bat foraging patterns and collect data points to determine habitat preferences, new roost locations, and foraging behaviors.
-          Roost-exit counts: Conduct spotlight checks and exit counts to identify roosting locations and estimate population size.
-          Acoustic survey: Deploy stationary bat acoustic recorders and collect, back up, and process acoustic output data.
-          Mist-netting: Assist mist-netting during specific periods to capture bats for radio telemetry, adhering to strict protocols and record-keeping procedures.
-          Insect sampling through maintenance of camera traps.

-          Willing to work long, irregular hours, including weekends and nights, under varied and adverse conditions, including rugged terrain and dense brush where exposure to poison ivy, thorns, and mosquito swarms are inevitable.
 Desired Qualifications

-          Experience with radiotelemetry.
-          GPS, map reading, and orienteering skills. 
-          Completion of one successful research or management field season.

Student contractors will be selected for one primary duty, though opportunities to participate in additional study components may be available.

This position involves intensive field work in wetland and upland habitats. Primary duties may include nest searching; nest monitoring; vegetation sampling; capture and attachment of transmitters to multiple species of waterbirds, including ducks, shorebirds, pelicans, gulls, and cormorants; conducting waterbird and habitat surveys; collecting ecological and habitat data; identifying waterbirds; and assisting with the operation of government vehicles (including 4WD vehicles), kayaks, and ATVs. Additional responsibilities may include data entry, compilation, quality control, and organization of field data in spreadsheets and tabular formats. The ideal applicant will have an interest in waterbird and waterfowl ecology, wetland and upland habitats, and applied field research. Desired skills include experience with bird identification, nest searching, bird captures and handling, habitat surveys, or ecological field data collection. Applicants must be able to work independently and as part of a team, demonstrate strong organizational skills and attention to detail, and be willing to work long hours, including early mornings, evenings, at nighttime, and some weekends as needed. Previous experience with waterbird identification, nest searching, or field-based ecological data collection is desirable.

Work schedules will vary depending on field activities. These are paid student contractor positions, with compensation commensurate with the role and level of responsibility of the position on the team (range: $23.48 – $32.54/hr). The anticipated start dates will be between March 15 and April 1, 2026. Final end dates will depend on the project, but projects are likely to be finished by June 26.

This position will be based out of the USGS office in Dixon, California, and may include multi-day trips to remote locations for field work.

To qualify as a student contractor, applicants must be current undergraduate or graduate students, or recent graduates (within the past 12 months).

Description
 

Student Contractors 
Biological Science Technicians 
 
The Western Ecological Research Center (WERC) of the USGS has an immediate opening for eight student interns or recent graduates (within the past year) to work as part of a team collecting forest data in the Sierra Nevada. Six students will be crew members and two will be crew leaders. 

The students will be participating in a team effort to collect forest health, fire, and fuels data. Duties include measuring tree diameters and heights, recording fuels, mapping trees, and identifying insects and diseases in order to conduct tree mortality assessments. An interest in natural resources, experience hiking (backpacking experience strongly preferred), strong interpersonal and communication skills, and the ability to collect forest health, fire, and fuels data are required. Crew lead positions will require prior leadership experience and will have the additional responsibilities of crew safety, protocol training, field logistics, and compiling/processing data.  

Work will primarily be performed in the field. Locations include Sequoia National Park, Yosemite National Park, and surrounding National Forest Service land. Elevations range from approximately 5,000 – 12,000 feet. Crews will typically work four 10-hour days per week, although they may be required to work as many as eight days consecutively to accommodate trips into the wilderness. Field sites are in front country and back country locations with off trail travel and some backpacking required. Conditions will be variable, and crews will work in challenging conditions including burn areas, heat, cold, shrub fields, biting insects, and high elevation. Work will be conducted from May through September with the potential for flexibility based on students’ schedules.  
 These are paid student contractor positions. The level of education required is at least 1 year of college. Compensation is commensurate with the role and level of responsibility of the position on the team, ranging from approximately $16.73 (1 year of college) for basic crew work to $26.03 (recent BA/BS or MA/MS graduates) for an independent crew lead.  
 Duration of work will be for up to one year, with an estimated starting date of 5/18/2026 for crew members and 4/20/2026 for crew leads.  
 The people selected will be based out of the Sequoia Kings Canyon Field station in Three Rivers, CA.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), located in Manhattan, Kansas.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

The National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Manhattan, KS is a state-of-the-art facility operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that is designed to help protect the nation’s agriculture, farmers and citizens against the threat and potential impact of serious animal diseases. The Biologics Development Module (BDM) is a unique applied research laboratory space within NBAF tasked with the mission of transitioning research developments into products. The BDM operates at a BSL-2 level of biosafety and is equipped to provide the needed functions to de-risk veterinary countermeasure product development.

Research Project: The BDM is in the process of developing a hybridoma and immunological reagents repository with the capacity to support current and future livestock immunology needs as well as to better assist the transition of immunological reagent dependent products to industry partners. Hybridomas provided to the BDM by USDA and outside partners will need to be propagated, preserved, and antibodies evaluated for both production and continued efficacy. This project will consist of helping in the recovery of cryo-preserved hybridoma cells and propagating them for creation of additional cell stocks. Select hybridomas may also be targeted for further evaluation relating to their potential efficacy for usage by industry partners.

The participant will collaborate with the Director of the Biologics Development Module. Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will provide scientific input in the recovery and propagation of cell cultures, specifically hybridomas, and be involved in developing and implementing methodologies and SOPs utilizing BDM and NBAF resources for the recovery of hybridoma cells and the production and purification of monoclonal antibodies.

Learning Objectives: The participant will learn about reagent development and testing for diagnostic and vaccine product development in a regulated environment, and technology transfer strategies from public to private laboratory settings. 

Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Steven Witte (steven.witte@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: Early 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Description

This recruitment will be used to fill one full-time Temporary Biological Sciences Research Technician 1 position for the Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society at Oregon State University (OSU). This position is located in Coos Bay, Oregon.

This position will support field data collection associated with a graduate research project focused on the effects of forest edges on Marbled Murrelet nesting habitat at the Elliott State Research Forest in the Central Coast Range of Oregon. The project PI is Meg Krawchuk, and the project team includes a diverse team of scientists. The position will join the Department of Forest Ecosystems & Society, in the College of Forestry. The goal of this project is to evaluate the effects of different forest edge types on various indicators of habitat quality in potential Marbled Murrelet stands. These indicators include canopy microclimate, nest predator abundance (such as ravens and jays), and epiphyte community characteristics. The results from this study aim to inform future management of Marbled Murrelet habitat in Oregon and present a better understanding of edge effects on the species.

The position will assist a graduate student by providing ground support for tree climbers, taking tree and vegetation measurements, and deploying and maintaining autonomous recording units (ARUs) at field sites. Field conditions for this project include steep terrain and can include navigation through challenging vegetation.

Breakdown of work duties:
25% – Assisting with ground support for tree climber(s), including but not limited to: assisting with transporting climbing gear from work vehicle to field sites, helping keep ropes untangled on the ground, fastening field equipment and tools to climbing rope for climber to use in the canopy (including the tying of several basic knots and hitches), and alerting tree climber of any hazards during climbing.

25% – Programming and deploying autonomous recording units (ARUs) at various field sites in the project area. This includes ensuring each unit has fully charged batteries and correct recording settings before deployment and performing maintenance checks when necessary.

30% - Performing inventories of understory composition (e.g. as a percentage of fruiting ground plants in a 10-meter radius circular plot at transect locations).

20% – Data recording using paper datasheets, following established protocols.Field work requires driving between field site locations.


This position requires the ability to work long hours outdoors in in all weather conditions in a remote forested environment. The ability to traverse steep, rugged, and/or uneven terrain is required.

The anticipated required work schedule will be 4 days on and 3 days off, with workdays typically lasting 10 hours. There may be some degree of variability. The field season starts in early-April and concludes in early to mid-September.

Lodging during fieldwork for the first part of the field season (early April into May) will be in hotels or Airbnb’s near the Elliott State Research Forest (likely in Reedsport or Coos Bay). However, some overnight camping will be required later in the field season, which we will do at one of several dedicated camping sites in the forest (there are no facilities, so we will bring our own water, food, and toiletries for a given work week).

Required Qualifications
Two years of college-level courses in forestry, natural resources or closely related field; OR an equivalent combination of training and experience.
Must possess good interpersonal skills and be able to work independently for long hours outdoors, and as part of a team.
Must possess a strong attention to detail.
Experience with fieldwork under strenuous conditions, including steep terrain, and demonstrated capacity to work in a range of weather conditions.
Ability to work collaboratively and respectfully with colleagues, partners, and stakeholders from various backgrounds.

This position requires driving a university vehicle or a personal vehicle on behalf of the university; therefore, the incumbent must successfully complete a motor vehicle history check, possess and maintain a current, valid driver’s license in their state of residence, be determined to be position qualified and self-report convictions as per University Policy 05-030.

Preferred Qualifications
Experience working in the Oregon Coast Range.
Experience conducting understory vegetation surveys.
Interest or experience working with autonomous recording units (ARUs) and maintaining them throughout a field season (replacing batteries and SD cards).
Interest or experience working with tree climbers or arborists or assisting with arboreal work.
Experience working long field seasons (4+ months).

Description
The University of Nevada, Reno is seeking 2-3 field technicians to assist in collecting data to estimate movement, densities, and site occupancy of two woodrat species along a secondary contact zone near San Miguel, CA. The technicians will primarily be trapping and collaring woodrats and entering data, working both independently and directly with other technicians and the PhD student directing the project. 

Weather permitting, traps will be opened at dusk and checked approximately six hours later with the moving of traps occurring during the early morning. Technicians must be flexible to last minute schedule changes and exhibit a positive attitude. This is not a Monday-Friday, 9-5 job. Work will largely occur at night and hours will vary day to day - whatever is required to finish the work accurately. Technicians should generally expect to work a 6 days on/1 day off schedule, though off days may not occur on the same day each week. 

Technicians will be required to carry traps, navigate and geolocate through dense brush, handle woodrats, collar and track animals, take morphometric measurements, take non-invasive genetic samples, collect fecal samples, collect fleas and ticks, and take accurate notes while processing animals. Finally, the technician must be observant and must be able to identify woodrats and distinguish their middens or be able to pick up these skills quickly. Excellent verbal communication skills are required, as is a positive attitude towards supporting the team to achieve project outcomes.

Project will run from early April through late-July/early-August 2026. Salary: $3,000/month. 

Qualifications:

Applicants must have a valid driver’s license and ideally their own vehicle for personal use. 

Technician will ideally:

Have small mammal trapping experience (woodrat experience is a plus)
Possess knowledge and ability to identify small mammals
Experience maintaining clear communication with off-site supervisors 
Experience using GPS and contact collars on wild populations
Be able to maintain detailed, organized notes
Be able to maintain communication to support team morale and shared achievements
Be able to navigate dense vegetation and mark waypoints with a GPS unit
Be physically fit enough to walk multiple miles a day, sometimes with heavy bags of traps and other supplies, and the ability to remain on their feet for most the day
Be observant, a quick learner, and have an interest in small mammals/wildlife
Be able to deal with temperature extremes (both hot and cold)
Adaptable to an extremely varied sleep schedule 

Please submit a cover letter, CV, and contact information for three references (phone and email) by email to Anita Pilar Montero (amontero@unr.edu) and Marjorie Matocq (mmatocq@unr.edu).  Applications will be reviewed in the order they are received. Review will continue until the positions are filled.

 Position Description: Snowden Waterfowl Center of Excellence within the College of Forestry, Agriculture, and Natural Resources at the University of Arkansas at Monticello is seeking applicants for the position of Postdoctoral Research Associate to lead a team of researchers in understanding the potential impacts of wind energy development on waterfowl movement, distribution, and behavioral ecology. The postdoc will work closely with a team of internal and external research partners to develop a series of research questions that can be addressed using existing transmitter and band encounter data. Initial research objectives may include but are not limited to quantifying air space use, identifying major movement coordinators, assessing local/relocation movement behaviors around existing wind energy infrastructure, evaluating the effects of wind energy infrastructure on habitat selection and displacement of winter distributions. A predictive approach could use species distribution modeling coupled with dynamic landscape models or process-explicit models to simulate land-use change or disturbance to forecast shifts or displacement from preferred habitats. 
 The postdoc will be expected to lead the design of a series of new projects that could incorporate multi-species transmitter deployments and/or field-based drone surveys. We anticipate opportunity to evaluate the direct effects of infrastructure development by designing a before-after-controlled impact study, and developing predictive models aimed to guide best management practices for sitting future wind development projects. This position carries an annual salary of $65,000-$70,000 plus retirement and health benefits. Expected start date flexible, but as early as immediately. 
 Requirements: Applicants must have a PhD in ecology, wildlife sciences, geospatial sciences, landscape ecology, or a related field of study. The desired candidate will have knowledge and enthusiasm for waterfowl and experience with GPS transmitter data, geospatial analyses, remote sensing, and statistical and ecological modeling approaches that use modern statistical packages, open access google earth engine for deep learning, and modern mapping applications. Applicants must have a valid U.S. driver’s license or obtain the same within 60 days of starting employment. Field work is highly likely and overnight travel for field work and conference travel will be expected. 
 Application & Additional Information: Interested applicants should submit a cover letter, curriculum vitae, and list of references to osborne@uamont.edu. Applications will be viewed as they are received. For additional position information and initial applicant screening please send questions and application material by email to Dr. Douglas Osborne.

Early career economist or social scientist research participation opportunity 

Position summary: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Fort Collins Science Center is seeking an early career economist or social scientist to participate in one or more applied research projects conducted by the Social and Economic Analysis branch (https://www.usgs.gov/centers/fort-collins-science-center/science/social-and-economic-analysis-research-support-public). The candidate will be provided with important research and training opportunities, joining existing collaborations between USGS scientists and resource managers and scientists from other agencies within and outside the Department of the Interior.  

The immediate focus of this position will be working with teams to inform natural resource management on public land management issues, with an emphasis on western North America. The position will entail participating in economic and social science research, for example cleaning and analyzing data, designing and implementing surveys and interviews of federal public land managers, conducting mathematical or statistical modeling, interpreting results, and drafting and publishing research findings, all while working closely with staff from USGS and partner agencies. The position may participate in projects focused on wildland fire management, fish and wildlife management and conservation, and outdoor recreation, among others.  

Qualifications: To be eligible for consideration, candidates must have completed an MS degree or higher in economics, social science, natural resources management, or a related field. Candidates must either be currently enrolled at a college or university or have completed their latest graduate degree within the last 12 months. Applicants must be U.S. citizens and undergo a background check. 

Candidates must have experience implementing economics or social science research. Experience with quantitative data analysis is desired, including but not limited to analyzing and modeling survey, spatial, or other data in open-source coding platforms (e.g., Program R, Python). Experience with qualitative research methods is also desired, including but not limited to developing interview or survey tools and analyzing results (e.g., using NVivo).  

Applicants must demonstrate excellent written and oral communication skills and a strong desire to work with natural resource managers on public land management issues in western North America. Familiarity with public land or species management, wildland fire and fuel management, or recreation on public lands is desired. Applicants should also possess strong collaboration and time-management skills.  

Either full-time or part-time candidates will be considered. Remote options are available. 

This position will be hired as a student services contractor.

Description
Wichita State University is seeking one highly motivated lead technician to lead a team of plant technicians for data collection. This is a collaborative research project investigating the response of plants, birds, and soils to different cattle grazing practices on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grasslands in Kansas and Colorado. Although grazing animals such as bison historically played an important role in native prairie, grazing is currently excluded or highly limited in many CRP sites related to native prairie. Our study will quantify potential conservation risks and benefits of cattle grazing on CRP sites located in tallgrass (Kansas) and shortgrass (Colorado).

The crew lead will manage plant data collection in three-person sampling crews (two technicians and one lead). The crew will be responsible for sampling a subset of sites (36) in our areas of interest in Colorado. Reaching sites will require the team lead to drive a few hours each day over paved and low maintenance (dirt, gravel) roads in relatively remote, rural areas. Duties include but are not limited to: collecting vegetation structural data, plant species abundance, and plant biomass; data entry and quality control; and equipment preparation and maintenance. The lead technician will be responsible for compiling data at the end of each day and running code script to ensure quality and accuracy. The lead technician will also delegate tasks to technicians and themselves, along with communicating tasks and implementing protocols with the lead graduate student who will be stationed near central Kansas (Stafford or St. John). Candidates must be willing to hike long distances into field sites through short grass prairie while carrying equipment to reach sampling locations. Working hours will be spent almost exclusively in the field and involve early mornings (due to extreme heat), long hours when necessary, and maintaining motivation during variable weather conditions. The lead technician must be able to transport themselves to Wichita, KS for initial orientation, followed by transporting themselves to field housing in Colorado. The lead technician must be ready to begin training and orientation in mid-late May 2026. The field position will end by August 8th, 2026. Shared housing will be provided near field sites near Lamar, CO. Rental vehicles will be provided for fieldwork transportation and the driver’s age must be 21+. The lead technician will be paid $19/hour with the possibility for time-and-a-half overtime pay.

Qualifications:

1)      Academic training in and/or enthusiasm for biology and/or ecology.
2)      Previous experience with plant identification preferred, but not required.
3)      Prior experience (formally or informally) managing a team of technicians for field work or other similar job.
4)      Fit to perform and keep up field work while maintaining exceptional work ethic in a variety of conditions, including heat, humidity, rain, biting insects, and poison ivy.
5)      Eager to work in remote, rural settings for long periods of time.
6)      Good interpersonal skills and willingness to work and live with other technicians and interact positively with CRP landowners.
7)      Clear and effective communication with technicians, graduate student, and project manager.
8)      Attention to detail and able to closely follow a detailed data collection protocol.
9)      Possess a valid driver’s license and willing to drive rental field vehicles on gravel and muddy roads. Must be 21 years of age by the start of the field season to drive field vehicles.
10)  Must be available for the entirety of the field season ~mid/late May to August 8th, 2026 with little to no absences greater than 3 days (excluding illness).

The lead technician will gain experience with plant identification and data collection techniques, interact with private landowners, and large-scale ecological research. To apply, email the following documents either as separate word documents or a combined PDF: 1) cover letter, 2) your CV/resume, and, 3) the names and contact information of three professional references. Please email these documents with the subject line “Summer Plant Ecology Crew Lead” to Evalynn Trumbo at evalynn.trumbo@wichita.edu. Application review will begin February 7th, 2026.

Description
Job Summary/Basic Function: Lake Superior State University (LSSU) seeks qualified applicants for a tenure-track faculty position in Aquaculture starting in August 2026. This is a 9 month, tenure-track position in the School of Natural Resources that is funded through a partnership between LSSU and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) titled the Partnership for Aquaculture Research and Management (PARM). The PARM position has administrative (25%), research (45%), teaching and mentoring (25%), and service (5%) responsibilities, and will be responsible for supporting aquaculture initiatives that address university and MDNR interests. The core appointment is based on a 9-month academic contract. However, due to the year-round needs of the hatchery and the PARM program, the position includes additional expectations during the winter and summer terms, and these will be compensated by an additional stipend.
Administrative responsibilities include, but are not limited to, providing vision for and year-round oversight of CFRE Fish Hatchery operations, developing and managing the hatchery operational budget, supervising hatchery personnel, and working with internal and external partners to ensure smooth operation of the hatchery. Research responsibilities include creating an active, externally-funded research program in aquaculture that engages students and supports LSSU and MDNR research needs, publishing research results in peer-reviewed scientific journals, presenting at professional conferences, acquiring external funding for research, and maintaining and developing collaborative relationships with state, federal, and tribal agencies. Teaching responsibilities may include teaching Freshwater Fish Culture, Internship in Aquaculture, Apprenticeship in Fish Culture, and thesis mentoring (Senior Project and MS Project). Mentoring undergraduates and graduate students engaged in research is expected.
LSSU is a small (<2,000 undergraduate students) state university located in the beautiful Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The campus sits on the St. Marys River, the sole outflow of Lake Superior and international boundary with Canada, and provides numerous educational and professional opportunities in aquaculture, fisheries management, and aquatic ecology. Additionally, LSSU is surrounded by three Great Lakes and many state, provincial, and national forests and parks that provide tremendous recreational opportunities and a high quality of life.

Terrestrial Ecological Monitoring Crew Leads/Botanists: O’Connor Center for the Rocky Mountain West

The University of Montana (UM) O’Connor Center for the Rocky Mountain West (OCRMW) is partnering with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to implement their Terrestrial Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) strategy. This protocol is targeted at collecting standardized inventory and long-term vegetation and soils data at multiple scales across BLM Districts in the Western U.S.  

We are currently recruiting Crew Leads/Botanists with experience in botany, ecology, and soil science for data collection in Montana from May through late August or early September. Must be able to start on or before May 13th and commit through at least August 4. 

The Crew Lead/Botanist will lead 1-2 technicians to collect vegetation and soils data in desert, sagebrush-steppe, and grassland ecosystems. Crews work eight-day hitches: 10-hours/day, from Tuesday-Tuesday, with a six-day break between hitches. All positions are field-based and require working and camping in isolated regions. We ask seasonal staff to commit to the entire field season, practice safety awareness, safe driving policies, and contribute to building a healthy, productive and enjoyable work environment. 

Applicants should understand that this is physically demanding work. Crews often work and camp in inclement weather conditions, frequently navigating rough, unpaved roads in 4x4 vehicles, and carrying heavy loads (35 lbs.) on foot over rugged desert and mountainous terrain. Sampling locations are occasionally near a small town, but these towns often have few amenities. Primitive camping is required. Cell phone service is limited. 

UM supplies all necessary monitoring equipment, including vehicles, to carry out the work. We provide some group camping gear (stoves, coolers). Individuals are responsible for their personal camping gear (tents, sleeping bags) but UM does assist employees with purchasing some field/camping equipment, up to $500 value.

Position: Environmental Markets Analyst [Summer, 2026]

Company: Magnolia is an environmental conservation company that develops mitigation projects across the United States. Magnolia is pioneering a new era in environmental stewardship by leveraging compliance-based markets to drive large-scale, impactful conservation and restoration efforts. Project developers such as energy companies and public entities purchase mitigation from Magnolia to maintain compliance with the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, and other federal or state
regulations. To date, we have conserved nearly 30,000 acres (and counting!) of critical habitat for dozens of rare and endangered species nationwide, the majority of which have been endangered bird and bat mitigation projects for wind and solar developers. Alongside species mitigation, Magnolia has established flourishing markets for wetland mitigation throughout the Midwest. We are growing quickly and are looking to identify talented and inspired people to join our multidisciplinary team. Learn more at www.mitigation.org.

Responsibilities: As an Environmental Market Analyst at Magnolia, you will have the opportunity to
join one of the company’s core teams and work alongside the people at the vanguard of compliancebased environmental conservation. Our teams collaborate closely, so you will likely work on projects and tasks across different areas of the company. Working at a small start-up, Magnolia’s Environmental Market Analysts will contribute directly to the creation of real-world conservation projects around the country.

1) Land Team: The Land Team is charged with finding, assessing, and acquiring potential conservation sites using a variety of methods including, but not limited to, geospatial analysis, on-site assessments, in-person meetings, and real estate transactions. Environmental Market Analysts will assist with outreach to potential partner landowners and organizations across the United States. Day-to-day tasks include species data analysis, GIS mapping, and drafting conservation documents. Experience with GIS software, technical reading/writing, or rural real estate are a bonus but not required.

2) Regulatory Team: The Regulatory Team is responsible for working with various governmental agencies and NGOs to develop and approve new conservation projects. This team manages agency relationships, drafts regulatory filings, and maintains a deep understanding of the mechanics of each environmental market in which we operate. Day-to-day tasks include communicating with environmental agencies, drafting regulatory documents, and researching market guidelines. Experience with proposal-writing, technical reading/writing, or GIS software is a bonus but not required.

3) Growth Team: The Growth Team manages relationships with mitigation buyers, exploring opportunities to provide these offsets to new companies or into new geographies. Growth Team members market and sell environmental mitigation credits to a variety of entities across the country, including large-scale renewable energy and infrastructure projects, by analyzing trends in clean energy markets, managing relationships with developers, and staying up to date with compliance-based mitigation requirements. Day-to-day tasks include market research, sales prospecting, reaching out to new clients, and drafting sales proposals. Experience in a sales role or proposal-writing is a bonus but not required.

Beyond team-specific tasks, Environmental Analysts will assist with daily operations at the company, which may include some combination of the following: proposal-writing, marketing and branding, restoration ecology, data analysis, market research, and administrative tasks. Past analysts have produced valuable work that has positively impacted the trajectory of the company. This is an opportunity to leave a real impact at a mission-driven startup company that is operating in the new and growing field of environmental offsets!

Eligibility/Qualifications: Magnolia is searching for candidates who share our enthusiasm for entrepreneurship, conservation, and market-based environmental solutions. An ideal candidate will be intellectually curious, resourceful, proactive, and comfortable collaborating with a small team. Applicants must be students enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate degree program graduating in 2026 or 2027. Ability to work eight to ten weeks is strongly preferred.

Compensation: Environmental Market Analysts will receive a base stipend of $3,000 per month, subject to increase, depending on an applicant’s need to relocate and ability to receive funding from partner academic institutions. To promote the use of public transportation by team members, Magnolia will cover the cost of daily transit to and from the office (limitations may apply).

Location: We anticipate that this will be a hybrid-model internship with a preference for applicants who are able to be physically present in either our Philadelphia or Chicago office for at least a portion of the summer. This position offers flexible start and end dates.

Application Deadline: March 1st, 2026. Applications will be accepted until the deadline, but will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

How to Apply: Send your resume and your responses to the questions below as PDF attachments to hiring@mitigation.org. Please include [Environmental Markets Analyst - Name] in the subject line. Cover letters are not required and will not be reviewed. The email body should indicate which office you would like to work in and rank the teams by your interest in them. Please note that applications sent via Handshake or LinkedIn will NOT be reviewed.

Life Net Nature Ecuador Bird Monitoring Expedition A Cost-share Volunteer Training Experience

Learn or improve bird banding and monitoring skills in the tropical Andes mountains of western Ecuador. Help advance science about tropical montane forest bird communities. Learn how to collect data to determine community and species-level responses to deforestation, forest recovery, forest fragmentation, and landscape and climate changes. Your participation helps sustain an important protected area in the mega-diverse Choco Endemic Bird Area (EBA). 

Cost-share volunteers/trainees assist Dr. Dusti Becker with long-term avian monitoring and conservation in the Andes at the beautiful forest protected area, Reserva las Tangaras.  In exchange volunteers receive experience-based training in mist netting and bird banding, including the use of Hall traps and practice with hummingbird banding. 

Team Dates:      August 9-22, 2026 (6 positions available)

                             December 7-20, 2026 (2 positions available)

Where:  Reserva Las Tangaras, a 130-acre nature preserve, boasts more than 25 species of hummingbirds, dozens of colorful tanagers, the largest regional Andean cock-of-the-rock display lek, along with over 300 tropical bird species, many of which are Choco and Andean endemics. During the expedition, LNN teams typically detect around 175 - 200 different species of birds in the reserve and study area. Team members always see additional bird species while traveling to and from the project site. The reserve is also home to endangered capuchin monkeys, spectacled bears, cougars, and myriads of other wildlife species, including several rare and endangered rain frogs. 

Activities: Volunteers are trained (or refreshed on) setting up and monitoring mist nets, extracting birds from nets, carrying birds from nets to banding stations, and recording ornithological and ecological data in the field. Volunteers are also trained to band birds and make standard measurements of birds. Volunteers also learn about Hall trapping and banding hummingbirds. The site is rugged, requiring above average fitness including: ability to hike on steep, potentially muddy and slippery terrain, and cover 2-4 miles on foot per day. Back or joint impairments, or obesity may make the project too challenging for some. 

Volunteers will have time to explore the Mindo area, and the team visits higher-elevation Bellavista Cloud Forest Reserve on the last day before returning to Quito. The December team will participate in the Mindo Christmas Bird Count (CBC), which typically wins first or second place globally for bird species counted. 

Food and Lodging: Accommodation is in a spacious research cabin, where each participant has a single bed mattress with mosquito netting, pillow, and fitted sheet. Two showers with hot water and flush toilets provide comfortable field accommodations. Meals are delicious, home-style Ecuadorian, prepared by excellent cooks, and vegetarian diets can be accommodated. 

COST: Your contribution of $2450 covers transportation during the field project to and from Quito,Ecuador, meals at RLT, lodging at RLT, reserve entrance fees, salaries for Ecuadorian cooks and para-biologists, leader's costs, and a special lunch at the Bellavista Reserve. Airfare to and from Quito, Ecuador and expenses in Quito before and after the expedition are not included. Meals away from RLT during project are not included. 

Your cost-share helps sustain Reserva las Tangaras, supporting year-round stewardship, educational programs, outreach materials about cloud forest wildlife, maintenance of trails and signs, cabin repairs, and feeding of resident hummingbirds. Cost-share donations are used to operate the 2-week field expedition: providing the team with food, shelter, training and transportation, as well as purchasing new project equipment and supplies. 

This exciting conservation expedition begins and ends in Quito, Ecuador. 

Contact Dr. Dusti Becker, dustizuni@yahoo.com, for further details and to obtain a Life Net Nature volunteer application form. 

Qualifications: Experience with banding and mist-netting are desirable, but not required. We provide training. Students and recent graduates will benefit from this great resume building experience. Professionals and retirees in field biology, will enjoy the ""field camp"" experience and are much appreciated for their co-mentoring and experiences they share. All participants have the option of using the > 20 year project database for research publications, undergraduate projects, or graduate degrees.  

Visit https://lastangaras.wordpress.com/who-are-we/ for more details about Life Net Nature and Reserva Las Tangaras.  

To apply: Email Dr. Dusti Becker a brief cover e-mail detailing your experience and interest in participating on a given team. Send to dustizuni@yahoo.com. (Resume optional and helpful).  Dr. Becker will send you an official Life Net Nature volunteer application form.

About the Site


Everglades National Park was the first national park established to protect biological diversity and supports a mix of temperate and tropical plants, animals, and ecosystems. Summer weather is hot and humid. The nearest community, Florida City/Homestead, is approximately 10 miles away and offers gas stations, grocery stores, movie theaters, restaurants, and shopping.


The greater Miami area has a majority (approximately 70%) Latino population (South Florida vernacular often uses the term Hispanic), with a majority of Cuban Americans (approximately 54%), followed by other Central and South American and Caribbean nationalities.


Previous interns have noted the wide selection of local grocery stores, which offer more than a single “ethnic food” aisle. Hispanic foods are especially common in the Homestead area, making this an especially welcoming location for interns from Hispanic backgrounds.

Dates: 5/27/26 – 8/15/26 (flexible start and end dates)

Job Description: We are seeking a motivated technician to assist with data collection on butterfly and bee research projects. This individual will aid in surveying butterflies, bees, flowering plants, and components of vegetation composition and structural data in mixed-grass prairie communities in the Prairie Pothole Region. 

The technician will be trained in the following skills for this position:

·        Identifying and counting grassland floral species
·        Conducting line-transect distance sampling for butterflies
·        Photographing and ID-ing live butterflies
·        Catching bees with sweep nets and handling bees with catch jars
·        Photographing and ID-ing live bees
·        Conducting quadrat-based cover class vegetation surveys
·        Conducting structural data collection (Robel poles, litter depth)
·        Data entry and management
·        Opportunities may be available for lab bee ID  

Field work will be conducted at the Central Grasslands Research Extension Center, which is made up of approximately 5,300 acres of mixed-grass prairie and cropland. The individual’s work will focus on critical mixed-grass prairie habitats and will utilize sites with various cattle grazing strategies. The REC’s location in the globally significant Prairie Pothole Region offers an unparalleled opportunity for field experience in a unique ecosystem which provides critical grassland habitat for an incredible diversity of wildlife and plants. Spending a summer immersed in what was once one of the largest grassland-wetland ecosystems is an exceptional experience for any candidate interested in conservation, range management, or wildlife/pollinator ecology!  

Typical challenges associated with working in grasslands do apply, as field work will take place outdoors. Expect wide-ranging weather conditions, intense sun, mosquitos, ticks, long days working in the field, lots of walking, and exposure to intense sun, mosquitos, ticks, cattle, and hot/humid weather. Weekly-schedule will be variable. 

The technician will be directly supervised by Taleigh Adrian, a PhD student, and will interact with NDSU faculty, students, and other research technicians. Housing will be provided. Start and end dates are flexible. 

Qualifications: Candidate must possess strong organizational and logistical skills, a commitment to data accuracy, and the ability to work independently for long hours under challenging field conditions. Candidate must be willing to work 40 hours per week on a variable schedule that will be dictated by weather (varying hours/day, varying days of the week). Candidate must be able and willing to work on a variable schedule and with challenges associated with grassland field work.  

The successful candidate will be expected to live and work very closely with other team members, so the ability to work well as part of a team and a positive attitude are important. Candidate must be willing to relocate to Streeter, ND for the summer from their current location- reimbursement for this would not be provided, but housing for the summer is provided. 

Preferred qualifications include field work experience, plant, pollinator, or insect identification experience, insect capture experience, or experience conducting/assisting with scientific field research. However, highly motivated candidates that don’t meet all (or any) of these qualifications are still encouraged to apply! Training will be provided. 

Applicants must have a valid driver’s license. A work vehicle will be provided for travel to and from survey sites, but all non-work driving (grocery, shopping, etc.) must be done in a personal vehicle (thus a personal vehicle is highly recommended). 

To Apply: Please email the following to Taleigh Adrian at taleigh.adrian@ndsu.edu:

1) Resume/CV

2) Cover letter that discusses why you are interested in the position/what you want to gain from the opportunity and your qualifications

3) Dates of availability and if you have any pre-planned events during the summer

4) Contact information for three references. Ideally references would be able to speak to field work ability and/or ability to work independently. 

Feel free to reach out with any questions. Thank you for your interest!

Applications will be considered starting immediately and until the positions are filled.

Position Description
The Collaborative Conservation & Adaptation Planning and the Wetland and Riparian Ecology labs at Auburn University are seeking a full-time Postdoctoral Research Fellow to join the “Building the resilience of Gulf Coast blue economies in a changing world: A multiple case study” research initiative, which has been recommended for funding by Mississippi Alabama Sea Grant (*this post was made in anticipation of receiving final approval from the NOAA grants office). This mixed-methods project will constructively evaluate the long-term impacts of Sea Grant’s Gulf Resilience Community of Practice (CoP) and explore how resilience is understood, experienced, and implemented across a spectrum of coastal economies in Mississippi and Alabama.

The postdoc will work closely with Dr. Matthew Jurjonas (PI and Assistant Professor, Conservation Social Science) and Dr. Chris Anderson (Co-PI and Professor, Coastal Wetland Ecology) to co-lead project implementation. The position emphasizes community-based fieldwork, qualitative interviewing, focus groups, and comparative case study analysis, with three focal communities who have already expressed support for the project—representing a range of traditional, hybrid, and tourism-based blue economies. In addition, this position will help co-design a workshop at the CoP annual meeting designed to share results, foster dialogue, and strategize new directions for today’s changing coastal resilience context toward the end of the project.

The position will start in the Spring 2026, and the starting salary is $55,000. In addition, the position includes an annual research and travel budget to support fieldwork, professional development, and dissemination activities.

Key Responsibilities
Develop and implement a program evaluation protocol that constructively evaluates the impact, potential opportunities, and future directions of the Resilience CoP.  
Collaboratively refine and implement a robust qualitative multiple case study design based on Yin’s methodology in three Gulf Coast Communities

Contribute to the development of peer-reviewed publications, a practitioner-focused policy brief, and outreach materials.
Participate in regular team meetings, project planning, and stakeholder engagement.
Present findings at national and regional conferences (e.g., Gulf of America Alliance, Social Coast Forum, International Association for Society and Natural Resources).

Qualifications
Required:
PhD in Environmental Social Science, Human Dimensions, Geography, Sociology, Public Policy, or a related field by the start date.
Demonstrated experience conducting qualitative research (e.g., interviews, coding, case study design).
Strong writing skills with a track record of scholarly publication.
Interest in community resilience, adaptation, and coastal blue economies.
Experience working with diverse partners, including government agencies, extension, and NGOs.
Interest in contributing to the CCAP lab’s culture of collaborative community-engaged science.

Position Description – Salamander Technicians in Northwestern Montana – 1 total position
 Project Description- Coeur d’Alene salamanders (Plethodon idahoensis) are the only known species of Plethodon (lungless) salamanders in the state of Montana. This species is considered imperiled in the state of Montana as well as a Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) and Species of Greatest Inventory Need (SGIN). This is, in large part due to limited information about this species, including its distribution in the state, population size, and specific habitat needs and availability. In 2022 Montana Natural Heritage program completed a habitat preference model which identified potential habitat in Montana, and FWP developed methods to detect site occupancy with eDNA (Coltrane et al. 2026). This PhD project will build upon previous research on Coeur d’Alene salamanders in Montana to fill gaps in our knowledge and better understand the status and requirements for the persistence of this species in Montana. This project is a collaboration between Montana State University and Montana, Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP); crew members will be employees of Montana State University. 
 Job Description- We are seeking 1 lead technician who will work with protocol leads in coordinating field work and supervising 2-3 technicians. The lead technician will lead crews of 2-3  and ensure crew members (i) access selected sites; (ii) safely conduct surveys for and capture Coeur d’Alene salamanders; (iii) collect genetic samples (tail clippings) from salamanders with proper PPE, sterile protocols, and handling protocols; (iv) collect morphometric measurements from salamanders; and (v) strictly follow decontamination protocols to ensure clean samples and mitigate the spread of disease among individuals. The lead technician will also be responsible for (i) maintaining a positive and respectful attitude that contributes to healthy team dynamics; (ii) following all field safety protocols and communicate clearly to prioritize safety in the field; and (vii) communicating personal and professional needs to project leads.

 Project Description- Coeur d’Alene salamanders (Plethodon idahoensis) are the only known species of Plethodon (lungless) salamanders in the state of Montana. This species is considered imperiled in the state of Montana as well as a Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) and Species of Greatest Inventory Need (SGIN). This is, in large part due to limited information about this species, including its distribution in the state, population size, and specific habitat needs and availability. In 2022 Montana Natural Heritage program completed a habitat preference model which identified potential habitat in Montana, and FWP developed methods to detect site occupancy with eDNA (Coltrane et al. 2026). This PhD project will build upon previous research on Coeur d’Alene salamanders in Montana to fill gaps in our knowledge and better understand the status and requirements for the persistence of this species in Montana. This project is a collaboration between Montana State University and Montana, Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP); crew members will be employees of Montana State University.

Be a U.S. citizen or legal resident.

Be between the ages of 18–30, or up to 35 if a veteran.

Position Description:
Salem Maritime National Historic Park and Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site seek an intern to research, refine, and deliver bilingual interpretive programs while continuing active outreach efforts with local Latino community groups.
In 2020, a Latino Heritage Intern at Salem Maritime developed a “Latino Commitment and Engagement Plan” after collaborating with local Latino community members to identify specific recommendations to improve inclusion at the park. This plan was refined and expanded by subsequent interns in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2025.
The Latino Heritage Intern will use interpretive themes and essential questions from Salem Maritime’s Foundation Document and Visitor Experience Plan (2020) and Saugus Iron Works’ Foundation Document and Visitor Experience Plan (2022) to research and develop audience-centered interpretive experiences focused on the parks’ natural and cultural resources. Potential programs may include historic house tours, maritime programs, nature walks, and tide walks.
The goal of the project is to create new park experiences attractive to the local Latino community. Currently, 23% of Essex County’s population (where Salem and Saugus are located) identifies as Hispanic or Latino. Programs may be bilingual but will primarily serve Spanish speakers. This aligns with a 2017 strategic plan for Salem and Saugus, which recommends prioritizing underrepresented students and groups to expand education programming (FY 2018–2023).
Throughout the summer, the intern will expand existing programs and connections within the Latino community, particularly in El Punto, a predominantly Dominican and Puerto Rican neighborhood near Salem Maritime. The intern will contact existing community partners and establish new relationships with leaders and organizations in Essex County. The intern will also represent the parks at community-organized special events and outreach programs. In 2026, the intern will support programming related to America 250 and Salem 400+ anniversary events.
DHA-RA Internship Deliverables include planning, preparing, promoting, and delivering:
A bilingual (Spanish–English), audience-centered interpretive and educational program at Salem Maritime and/or Saugus Iron Works, presented multiple times.
A special Latino Conservation Week event hosted at Salem Maritime NHP, featuring community partners such as the North Shore Community Development Coalition.
Written outlines, program materials, and vendor contacts for each program developed and presented.
Documentation of best practices for bilingual interpretive/educational programs in the Latino Commitment and Engagement Plan (2020) and presentation of recommendations to the Park Operations Team.
Since 2018, Salem Maritime and Saugus Iron Works have prioritized working with adult interns through LHIP and HBCU programs. The parks have continuously evaluated ways to improve hiring and program creation. Staff participate in regular supervisory trainings to create a positive work environment. Hosting adult interns has led to significant impacts, including new partnerships and inclusive content development for both online and on-site visitors. The program continues to provide employment opportunities for young adults while serving diverse communities around each park unit.
 
Responsibilities:
Research, develop, and deliver bilingual (Spanish–English), audience-centered interpretive and educational programs at both parks.
Use park Foundation Documents and Visitor Experience Plans to guide program development focused on natural and cultural resources.
Expand and refine the Latino Commitment and Engagement Plan by documenting best practices and presenting recommendations to park leadership.
Conduct outreach and build relationships with local Latiox community members, leaders, and organizations in Essex County.
Strengthen existing partnerships and establish new collaborations, particularly within the El Punto neighborhood and surrounding communities.
Represent the parks at community-organized events, outreach activities, and special programs.
Plan, promote, and present a bilingual interpretive program multiple times during the season.
Coordinate and help deliver a Latino Conservation Week event in collaboration with community partners.
Support planning and programming related to America 250 and Salem 400+ anniversary events.
Prepare program materials, outlines, and supplies; coordinate with external vendors as needed.

Qualifications:
Major in History, Anthropology, Sociology, Biology, Earth Sciences, Communications, or a related field.
Currently enrolled in or a recent graduate of an accredited undergraduate or graduate degree program.
Bilingual in Spanish and English, with strong communication skills for diverse audiences.
Interest in community engagement and serving underrepresented audiences.
Experience or interest in developing and delivering interpretive or educational programs.
Strong written and oral communication skills.
Ability to work independently and collaboratively in a team environment.

Learning Goals:
The LHIP intern will gain experience in:
Researching, developing, and implementing special programs and events for a diverse audience.
Creating and maintaining professional relationships with individuals and community groups.
Communicating ideas and arguments in Spanish and English, both written and verbally.
Working collaboratively with National Park Service staff across multiple workgroups, as well as with park partner organizations.

About the Site:
Salem Maritime and Saugus Iron Works are National Park Service units located in Essex County, MA. Salem is a historic coastal city of about 45,000 people, while Saugus is a more suburban town of 28,000. Both communities provide easy access to grocery stores, shopping malls, movie theaters, and concert venues. Multiple hospitals are available in Essex County, including one in Salem; world-class hospitals are available 20 miles away in Boston.

Description
 Would you like to live in the middle of the Amazon rainforest as part of a fantastic multicultural team while helping to preserve wild macaws? Add to that learning a new set of skills and gaining great field experience at one of the longest-running parrot projects in the Americas? If this sounds good to you, come and join our team of dedicated volunteers!

For over two decades, we’ve been working in the lowlands of southeastern Peru, led by Drs. Brightsmith and Vigo-Trauco from Texas A&M’s Schubot Center for Avian Health. Our research focuses on the breeding ecology of wild parrots and macaws in Tambopata, a region critical to conservation since 1999.

Volunteers are the backbone of our work, contributing thousands of hours to understanding these incredible birds. Whether you’re passionate about wildlife, have a background in biology, or are just eager to gain field experience, we welcome you to be part of this rewarding journey.

With various programs designed for all experience levels—from birdwatching enthusiasts to graduate-level professionals—there’s an opportunity for everyone who’s responsible, enthusiastic, and ready for an adventure in conservation. Are you ready for a hands-on conservation experience in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth? Come join us in making a real difference!

We have different volunteer assistantships programs that require different levels of experience from amateur enthusiasts and birdwatchers to graduate-level professionals. Volunteer activities vary according to the position.

LONG TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT

 Join our team and be trained to identify all local parrots by sight and sound. You’ll conduct parrot censuses in the forest and at clay licks, locate foraging parrots, and enter collected data into our system. During the macaw breeding season, you’ll learn to climb trees using rope systems and observe macaw behavior around nests. Additional duties include campsite setup and cooking. 

SHORT VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT

In this role, you will receive quick training to assist our field team in monitoring macaw nests from the ground, supporting the team that works with ropes. You will also be trained to monitor macaw behavior around nests and help with clay lick observations. Due to the shorter stay, involvement in activities like parrot censuses and tree climbing will be limited. Other responsibilities include campsite setup and cooking.

SPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION

Be part of the “Harrison's Bird Foods Internship in the Rainforest Program”! You will receive comprehensive training similar to our long-term volunteers, including parrot identification, conducting censuses, monitoring foraging behaviors, tracking tree species macaws use, and entering data. In addition to tree climbing and nest observation, you’ll also assist with macaw chick health checks, including taking biometric measurements. You’ll play a key role in our nest monitoring expeditions throughout the Tambopata River basin. As with all positions, activities include campsite setup and cooking. 

QUALIFICATIONS

LONG-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS:

Candidates must have previous field experience and experience working with birds. A degree in Biology, Ecology, Forestry, Wildlife Sciences, or a related field, or be close to graduation, is required. 

Additional Requirements: Volunteers should be in good physical condition, able to carry a 40 lb (18 kg) pack over moderate terrain for up to 2 km, and must have no fear of heights, particularly during the macaw breeding season (Dec-Mar). They should be able to work well in a team, handle stressful and challenging situations, and have travel insurance coverage

SHORT-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS 

Applicants should have some experience observing animals, either in the wild or in captivity, along with an appreciation for nature and wildlife. 

Additional Requirements:   
Volunteers need to be in average physical condition, capable of walking 2 km over moderate terrain. They should have strong observational skills, the ability to remain seated for long periods of time, and a basic knowledge of birds. Travel insurance coverage is also required.

SPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION

This position is available immediately, with a start date of November 28, 2024. Candidates must have previous field experience and experience working with birds, along with a degree or be in the final semesters of studies in Biology, Ecology, Forestry, or a related field. Some level of Spanish proficiency is also necessary.

Additional Requirements: Volunteers must be in good physical condition, able to carry a 40 lb (18 kg) pack over moderate terrain for up to 2 km and have no fear of heights (Dec-May). They should have a positive attitude toward facing new and challenging situations, be able to work well in a team under stress and have travel insurance coverage.

ACCOMODATIONS

Our headquarters are located in the Malinoski Biological Station which is located right where the Malinoski river joins the Tambopata River. The station is a two-story wooden house with electricity generated by a gasoline generator and 75 Gb internet. The rooms are for two people and bathrooms and showers are shared. The first floor has a large area for common use of the different teams of researchers who stay there.

COST
Essentially, volunteering is free. We take care of research permit costs, cover the costs of all staff, work to maintain training material, and also deal with all correspondence and various aspects of project management. However, our budget does not extend to being able to pay for all aspects of volunteer participation. As such you only need to cover food, accommodation, and other services provided by the field station. The costs are very reasonable. The daily fee is according to the position and experience:

• Long-term assistant: 30 USD/day 

• Short-term assistant: 45 USD/day 

• SPONSORED Long-term assistant: NO COST (Thanks to the generous sponsorship from Harrison's Bird Foods) 


*A one-time processing fee of $30 will be added for all volunteers.
This rate covers food (3 meals per day) and accommodations (bedding is provided). All volunteers will be charged an airport transfer to be picked up ($20) or dropped off ($10) at the airport plus an extra cost to be transported to the port in private transportation ($45). Once a volunteer was accepted, they will be sent an invoice by email from Texas A&M University. Upon receipt, the volunteer needs to pay 20% of the total cost of their stay. This non-refundable payment is required to hold the reservation for the assistant. The remaining 80% of the payment should be made at least two weeks before the assistant arrives at the release site. Arrangements can be made if assistants wish to pay in cash in the country. However, prior permission from the coordinator is needed. Changes to the daily fee may apply according to availability and season

Description
Would you like to live in the middle of the Amazon rainforest as part of a fantastic multicultural team while helping to preserve wild macaws? Add to that learning a new set of skills and gaining great field experience at one of the longest-running parrot projects in the Americas? If this sounds good to you, come and join our team of dedicated volunteers!

For over two decades, we’ve been working in the lowlands of southeastern Peru, led by Drs. Brightsmith and Vigo-Trauco from Texas A&M’s Schubot Center for Avian Health. Our research focuses on the breeding ecology of wild parrots and macaws in Tambopata, a region critical to conservation since 1999.

Volunteers are the backbone of our work, contributing thousands of hours to understanding these incredible birds. Whether you’re passionate about wildlife, have a background in biology, or are just eager to gain field experience, we welcome you to be part of this rewarding journey.

With various programs designed for all experience levels—from birdwatching enthusiasts to graduate-level professionals—there’s an opportunity for everyone who’s responsible, enthusiastic, and ready for an adventure in conservation. Are you ready for a hands-on conservation experience in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth? Come join us in making a real difference!

We have different volunteer assistantships programs that require different levels of experience from amateur enthusiasts and birdwatchers to graduate-level professionals. Volunteer activities vary according to the position.

LONG TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT

 Join our team and be trained to identify all local parrots by sight and sound. You’ll conduct parrot censuses in the forest and at clay licks, locate foraging parrots, and enter collected data into our system. During the macaw breeding season, you’ll learn to climb trees using rope systems and observe macaw behavior around nests. Additional duties include campsite setup and cooking. 

SHORT VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT

In this role, you will receive quick training to assist our field team in monitoring macaw nests from the ground, supporting the team that works with ropes. You will also be trained to monitor macaw behavior around nests and help with clay lick observations. Due to the shorter stay, involvement in activities like parrot censuses and tree climbing will be limited. Other responsibilities include campsite setup and cooking. 

SPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION

Be part of the “Harrison's Bird Foods Internship in the Rainforest Program”! You will receive comprehensive training similar to our long-term volunteers, including parrot identification, conducting censuses, monitoring foraging behaviors, tracking tree species macaws use, and entering data. In addition to tree climbing and nest observation, you’ll also assist with macaw chick health checks, including taking biometric measurements. You’ll play a key role in our nest monitoring expeditions throughout the Tambopata River basin. As with all positions, activities include campsite setup and cooking. 

QUALIFICATIONS

LONG-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS:

Candidates must have previous field experience and experience working with birds. A degree in Biology, Ecology, Forestry, Wildlife Sciences, or a related field, or be close to graduation, is required. 

Additional Requirements: Volunteers should be in good physical condition, able to carry a 40 lb (18 kg) pack over moderate terrain for up to 2 km, and must have no fear of heights, particularly during the macaw breeding season (Dec-Mar). They should be able to work well in a team, handle stressful and challenging situations, and have travel insurance coverage

SHORT-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS 

Applicants should have some experience observing animals, either in the wild or in captivity, along with an appreciation for nature and wildlife. 

Additional Requirements:   
Volunteers need to be in average physical condition, capable of walking 2 km over moderate terrain. They should have strong observational skills, the ability to remain seated for long periods of time, and a basic knowledge of birds. Travel insurance coverage is also required.

SPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION

This position is available immediately, with a start date of November 28, 2024. Candidates must have previous field experience and experience working with birds, along with a degree or be in the final semesters of studies in Biology, Ecology, Forestry, or a related field. Some level of Spanish proficiency is also necessary.

Additional Requirements: Volunteers must be in good physical condition, able to carry a 40 lb (18 kg) pack over moderate terrain for up to 2 km and have no fear of heights (Dec-May). They should have a positive attitude toward facing new and challenging situations, be able to work well in a team under stress and have travel insurance coverage.

ACCOMODATIONS

Our headquarters are located in the Malinoski Biological Station which is located right where the Malinoski river joins the Tambopata River. The station is a two-story wooden house with electricity generated by a gasoline generator and 75 Gb internet. The rooms are for two people and bathrooms and showers are shared. The first floor has a large area for common use of the different teams of researchers who stay there.

COST
Essentially, volunteering is free. We take care of research permit costs, cover the costs of all staff, work to maintain training material, and also deal with all correspondence and various aspects of project management. However, our budget does not extend to being able to pay for all aspects of volunteer participation. As such you only need to cover food, accommodation, and other services provided by the field station. The costs are very reasonable. The daily fee is according to the position and experience:

• Long-term assistant: 30 USD/day 

• Short-term assistant: 45 USD/day 

• SPONSORED Long-term assistant: NO COST (Thanks to the generous sponsorship from Harrison's Bird Foods) 


*A one-time processing fee of $30 will be added for all volunteers.
This rate covers food (3 meals per day) and accommodations (bedding is provided). All volunteers will be charged an airport transfer to be picked up ($20) or dropped off ($10) at the airport plus an extra cost to be transported to the port in private transportation ($45). Once a volunteer was accepted, they will be sent an invoice by email from Texas A&M University. Upon receipt, the volunteer needs to pay 20% of the total cost of their stay. This non-refundable payment is required to hold the reservation for the assistant. The remaining 80% of the payment should be made at least two weeks before the assistant arrives at the release site. Arrangements can be made if assistants wish to pay in cash in the country. However, prior permission from the coordinator is needed. Changes to the daily fee may apply according to availability and season

Position is funded for 7 months and we anticipate future funding for a potential extension of the appointment.

Responsibilities
·         Manage, process, and format data from an assortment of bat survey methods.
·         Implement rigorous data quality assurance/quality control measures and follow organization frameworks.
·         Maintain bat survey equipment and perform a variety of bat field surveys (acoustic, roost counts, mist netting, radio telemetry tagging and tracking, etc.) and vegetation identification and measurements, which will include some overnight travel (<25%).
·         Utilize open-source and internally developed software and report bugs and requests for additional features. Assist with development of our tools, primarily in Python and R programming languages.
·         Update and create GIS maps and products, perform spatial analyses (ideally with ArcGIS, QGIS, and GeoPandas or ArcPy), and manage ArcGIS online data and digital survey forms such as Survey123.
·         Regularly cooperate with Hub coordinator and principal investigators to manage multiple, simultaneous projects.
·         Effectively communicate with current and potential federal, tribal, state, and NGO partners, sub-contractors, and the public. 
·         Work with data in cloud storage, upload data to NABat, and manage and resolve errors with NABat partner portal projects.
·         Occasionally assist Hub coordinator with statistical analyses, report writing, website publications and updates, and professional presentations and outreach events (virtual and in-person).

Preferred Experience
·         Master’s degree in wildlife ecology, biology, environmental data science, or related field or bachelor’s and 2+ years of relevant experience.
·         Strong attention to detail and skills in data management and quality assurance/quality control, especially with scientific data.
·         Familiarity with bat acoustic data processing and manual vetting echolocation calls of Southeastern US bat species is desirable.
·         Ability to work independently and in groups in the field and the office and willingness to travel for multiple consecutive days (<25% of monthly activities).
·         Ability to traverse rough, uneven terrain while navigating in backcountry for up to a few miles on foot.
·         Modern smartphone with data plan to utilize our survey forms in the field.
·         Valid US class C driver's license and experience operating a 4-wheel drive vehicle on narrow, unmaintained roads.
·         Willingness to get a rabies pre-exposure vaccination and/or an up-to-date rabies titer (cost will be covered if needed).
·         Well-rounded, diverse experience is highly valued.

Disclaimers
·         Housing is not provided.
·         Occasional day/night outdoor work in moderate to strenuous conditions, potentially involving adverse weather, cold or hot and humid conditions, insects, and toxic plants.
·         Some overnight travel will be required (<25%), during which housing, per diem, and a field vehicle will be provided.

Description
The Wildlife Conservation Specialist (Summits Operative Team) will be a key member of the Wildlife Restoration Foundation (WRF) team designing and implementing the North American Summit on Collaborating with Wildlife (CW) in Park Gateways. The Wildlife Conservation Specialist (“Wild Spec”) will play vital roles in designing, planning, recruiting content and participants, and implementing the CW Summit in 2026. Depending on individual talents and experience, the Wild Spec will work closely with the WRF President, Director of Operations, Program Managers and/or Project Coordinators one on or both Summits to ensure smooth execution of the Summit methodology with sufficient resources, ample participation, and quality results. Please visit www.wildlifeandparks.org and www.nabsummit.org.
 The Summits are organized by WRF in partnership with dozens of organizations, government agencies, Tribes, and businesses. The Summits are politically neutral and a place where practitioners and researchers share and assess active and conceptual Models and Methodologies (M&Ms) connected to priority themes. The proven Workgroup Dialogue mechanism enables these M&Ms to be informed, strengthened, and replicated as attending practitioners gain new partners and resources. 
 The North American Summit on Collaborating with Wildlife in Park Gateways(CW Summit) vision is the rebuilding of a lost legacy of abundant, healthy and genetically-diverse populations of native North American wildlife thriving amidst human communities bordering park. Note that “Park” includes all kinds of areas set aside for wildlife, and can be federal, state, county, city or private parkland and waters including marine protected areas.
The CW Summit is co-hosted by the Oceans & Wildlife Institute (OWI) and WRF and will take place May 18-21, 2026 in Corpus Christi, Texas. 
  The WRF Wildlife Conservation Specialist (Wild Spec), in collaboration with WRF leadership, will select and/or be assigned various Summit tasks based on experience, talents and interests. These might be related to substantive content, outreach, logistics, Summit resources, and onsite implementation.

Description
*Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), located in Beltsville, Maryland.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

The Adaptive Cropping Systems Laboratory (ACSL) at the USDA-ARS Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) in Beltsville, Maryland conducts integrated experimental and modeling research to understand how crops respond to key abiotic factors such as weather, soil conditions, and management practices. Our team designs and carries out controlled experiments and develops, validates, and applies advanced mathematical models to investigate a wide range of agricultural challenges, including the impacts of extreme weather on crop production, land suitability assessment, food security, on-farm resource management, and farmer competitiveness.

Research Project: Students will participate in seasonal controlled-environment experiments (e.g., greenhouses and growth chambers) aimed at improving our understanding of how crop production responds to environmental conditions. Data generated from these studies supports scientists in identifying management strategies that enhance farm profitability and strengthen food security. Students will gain hands-on experience across multiple stages of seasonal experimental research.

Graduate Opportunities
Description
 Position: The Montaña Aquatic Ecology Lab (https://www.carmengmontana.com/) at the Department of Biology at Stephen F. Austin State University is recruiting a Master’s student to begin in Summer 2026 (preferred) or Fall 2026. The position is funded for 2 years, and will be based in the research group of Dr. Montaña at Stephen F. Austin State University (SFASU). Student will receive a stipend of $2,000/month and Nonresident (NR) tuition is waived (resident tuition fees apply). 
 Research Focus: This study will use a multiscale perspective to survey the freshwater fishes in streams/rivers of east Texas to identify relationships within basin-scale connectivity and stream flow and reach-scales physicochemical characteristics in the context of aiding the current distribution of imperiled fish species (shiners and suckers) within the Neches and Sabine River basins in Texas. 
This research will use a combination of fishing gears and sampling methods to accurately assess freshwater fishes with efforts focused on several native imperiled fish species. The surveys will be conducted on a yearly basis including three seasons (spring, summer, and fall) to better understand changes in fish assemblage dynamics over time. Surveys will also include multiscale habitat analysis to quantify habitats a finer (e.g., reach, mesohabitat) and broader (e.g., landscape) scales to help identify environmental variables associated with the occurrence of imperiled shiners and suckers over time. In addition, novel approaches based on PIT tagging and stable isotope analysis of carbon [δ13C], nitrogen [δ15N], and Sulfur (δ34S) will be conducted to evaluate and monitor movement patterns and habitat use by proposed imperiled species within the Neches and Sabine River basins. 
 Desired Qualifications: Individuals with research interests in aquatic ecology, fish ecology/fisheries, river/stream ecology, food-web ecology, and/or conservation ecology are especially encouraged to apply. Candidates must hold a Bachelor’s degree by the start date in Biology, Ecology, Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences, or related field. Demonstrated experience in fish sampling and identification; use of water quality meters, proficiency in Microsoft Office (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint), have an understanding of biodiversity metrics. Coding in R, ArGIS skills, and stable isotope processing is a plus, though all of these can be learned during graduate school. Experience with driving a boat/trailer is required. The ability to conduct rigorous fieldwork under extreme conditions (e.g., heat, humidity) will be necessary. Excellent communication, time-management skills, a strong work ethic and attention to detail also are essential. Self-motivated and able to work independently and collaboratively is expected. The candidate must also have a valid driver’s license (will need to get a Texas driver license). 
 About the Area/University: SFASU is located in Nacogdoches, Texas. The Department of Biology has (http://www.sfasu.edu/academics/colleges/sciences-math/biology) a diverse faculty with strengths in ecology and evolutionary ecology, conservation biology, botany, and cellular and molecular biology. Nacogdoches is a city with more than 33,000 residents. 
 Deadline: Review of applications will start March 1, 2026 and continue until the position is filled. The candidate is expected to begin in Summer 2026 (June 1 2026, preferred) or Fall 2026. Please send only one PDF file to Dr. Carmen Montaña (montanascg@sfasu.edu) with the following documents: 1) a cover letter outlining your research interests and experiences, 1) GPA scores,  3) Undergraduate transcripts (unofficial are accepted), 4) Curriculum vitae, 5)GRE scores (if available), 6) contact details of three references and 7) an example of your writing.

 Description 

The Young lab at Utah State University is seeking three (3) black bear hair snare technicians to assist with the Baldwin Bear Project.

Description
The Hopcroft lab within the College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (CFOS) is looking for a motivated individual with interests in the study of zooplankton within high latitude ecosystems. The lab spans the full spectrum of zooplankton groups from crustaceans to gelatinous taxa, from morphological to molecular identifications, and from net-based sampling to in situ imaging. The position will involve several weeks per year in the field (typically on larger research vessels), operation and maintenance of field-going electronic equipment, plus processing of samples in the laboratory and conducting preliminary analysis of the data generated. The opportunity also exists for varying degrees of involvement in scientific publication. Prior experience working with zooplankton is required, as is computer proficiency. Prior experience is desirable but not required for molecular laboratory work or imaging systems, as essential training on either can be provided.

CFOS is one of the most geographically diverse units at UAF. The College is headquartered in Fairbanks with additional locations in Anchorage and our coastal facilities include the Seward Marine Center, the NOAA-UAF Kasitsna Bay Laboratory, and the Juneau Lena Point Fisheries Facility. The College has over 150 faculty, researchers and staff based throughout Alaska. 

This is anticipated to be a long-term hire as part of larger team of zooplankton professionals and graduate students. This position is located on the Troth Yeddha' campus in Fairbanks Alaska. The position has some flexibility in work schedule and the number of hours worked per week, such that the successful candidate may elect to work less than full time if desired (i.e., from 20-40 hours per week).

This is a term-funded, exempt staff position complete with both a competitive salary and full employee benefits package. UA provides a generous compensation package that includes retirement options, annual leave, 12 paid holidays per year, tuition waivers for employees and family members, and affordable medical, dental and vision care coverage. New hires will be placed on the UA Staff Salary Schedule, Grade 79, based on education and experience.

Applications will be accepted for review on February 19, 2026, to ensure consideration, please apply by 11:55 PM, Alaska Standard Time on February 18, 2026. This position is open until filled.

Description
TITLE: Climate Change and Conservation Associate 
CLASSIFICATION: Full time
REPORTS TO: Climate and Conservation Manager
LOCATION: St. Paul, MN

SUMMARY
Friends of the Boundary Waters (Friends) has been the leading voice for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA) since 1976. Having played a role in the creation of the BWCA, we are looking to protect the BWCA and northeastern Minnesotan ecosystems from climate change for decades to come.

To this end, Friends is seeking a Climate Change and Conservation Associate. Friends has recently received a grant from the Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund (ENRTF) to fund a project entitled, The Impacts of Climate Change on Northeastern Minnesota. The Climate Change and Conservation Associate will assist in the implementation of this project.

Background on the ENRTF Grant:
Climate change is rapidly increasing temperatures in the Quetico-Superior ecosystem of northeastern Minnesota, impacting the habitat and wildlife of the region. A range of government, tribal, academic, and private entities have conducted research relating to existing and future impacts of climate change on the region; however, this information is siloed and fragmented across multiple databases and sources. As a consequence, it is difficult to develop a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of climate change on the region’s ecosystems and assess appropriate responses to these impacts.

Friends’ Climate and Conservation Program looks to provide leadership on climate resilience in the Boundary Waters and northern Minnesota. 

To address these challenges, through the ENRTF grant, Friends will:

(1) Lead a systematic review of climate research in the Quetico-Superior ecosystem while engaging local, state, and federal governments; tribal governments; academic institutions; and nonprofit organizations to collect and aggregate studies, research, management plans and other data relating to the impacts of climate change on land, water, wildlife, management, recreation, and human health in northeastern Minnesota. We will use this data to develop plain-language summaries of findings, identify major research opportunities in northeast Minnesota, test the efficacy of certain land management decisions, and illustrate what the future of northern ecosystems might look like depending on management decisions we make now. 

(2) Develop a publicly available, web-based hub of studies, research, management plans, and other information relating to the impacts of climate change on ecosystems in northeastern Minnesota. The website will serve several purposes. It will support public understanding of climate impacts, arm policy makers with climate-smart land management strategies, and inspire the next generation of ecologists in the region. 

The Climate Change and Conservation Associate will be responsible for assisting with these deliverables. 

These positions and this program will continue beyond the duration of the three-year ENRTF grant and will form the basis for the Friends’ new Climate Change and Conservation Program.

PRIMARY RELATIONSHIPS:

Reports directly to the Climate and Conservation Manager.
Works effectively with other departments within the Friends, including Development, Policy, Communications, Northern Communities, and Education.

RESPONSIBILITIES
Review and synthesize peer-reviewed manuscripts, reports, and data
Help to organize hundreds of peer-reviewed manuscripts and reports
Develop maps and public-facing resources that facilitate good land and water management in northeastern Minnesota
Engage local, state, and federal governments; tribal governments; academic institutions; and nonprofit organizations to identify their needs, collect and aggregate studies, research, management plans and other data relating to the impacts of climate change on the habitat and wildlife of northeastern Minnesota
Contribute to the development of a publicly available, web-based, electronic database of studies, research, management plans, and other information relating to the impacts of climate change on the habitat and wildlife of northeastern Minnesota
Monitor scientific and policy developments pertaining to climate change and wildlife conservation  in northeastern Minnesota
Represent Friends at events and serve as a spokesperson for Friends

QUALIFICATIONS
Masters degree in natural sciences with interdisciplinary experience, or 3 years applied experience with undergraduate degree in natural sciences
Understanding of climate change, land and water management (both strategies and tradeoffs), and ecology, particularly in northern ecosystems
Demonstrated ability to translate complex scientific data or research into easy-to-understand material appropriate for public consumption
Experience with GIS and map creation
Experience with data cleaning, carpentry, and summarization in R or Python (proficiency with meta-analysis is a plus)
Experience doing research synthesis and science communication with state, federal, Tribal, NGOs, or private sector partners
Initiative, good judgment, and a strong work ethic
Ability to work independently and in collaboration with staff and outside partners
Ability to engage positively with a broad array of people and constituencies, including Tribal governments
Ability to work on multiple projects of strategic importance while meeting deadlines
Experience navigating complicated political landscapes and relationships
Passion for conserving the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and the Quetico-Superior ecosystem

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS:
$60,000 – $70,000 per year
Paid vacation and sick leave, health and dental insurance, and a 403(b) retirement plan.
In addition to paid vacation and sick leave, Friends provides a $600 stipend and five additional paid vacation days to each employee to take time off and recharge in the Boundary Waters.
Flexible working hours and hybrid working options
We encourage life-long learning and ongoing professional development.

Description
Interested in animal behavior and invasive species? Do you want to help create novel and innovative devices that will manage invasive sea lamprey in the Great Lakes? 

The Applied Behavioral Ecology Lab at Michigan State University seeks one full-time (40 hrs. per week) temporary (May 1st – July 31st with some flexibility on start/end dates) research technician to assist with research projects related to the construction of selective fish passages. This position allows technicians to develop engineering skills and apply behavioral ecology to create means of controlling populations of invasive lamprey in the Great Lakes. We aim to design and test passages that will block lamprey access to rivers, while allowing native species to pass. 2026 projects will specifically investigate how turbulence and predation risk (via a chemical alarm cue) influence lamprey behavior and movement. 

Technicians will be engaged in testing selective fish passage devices by running behavioral experiments on sea lamprey in large indoor raceways. This will involve installing pit telemetry systems, configuring passage devices, implanting pit tags, observing and handling lamprey, preparing lamprey chemical cues, maintaining lab equipment, and data collection/analysis. Technicians may also have the opportunity to collaborate with Federal agency partners and other stakeholders. When working at Hammond Bay Station, housing will be provided nearby. 

Location: Hammond Bay Biological Station, Millersburg, Michigan 

Qualifications: Enrolled in or recently graduated from an undergraduate institution in the field of fisheries, ecology, biology, engineering, or a related discipline. Applicants must be comfortable handling animals and working in and around water. Our study species is nocturnal, so work will often take place at night, and requires technicians to lift up to 40 lbs. and spend long periods of time on their feet. Prospective technicians should work well in a team, but should be able to work independently as well, with a strong work ethic and positive attitude. University vehicles used for travel, drivers will need to have a satisfactory driver’s check. Experience working with power tools and performing building/maintenance tasks is preferred but not required.

The Applied Behavioral Ecology Lab at Michigan State University seeks one full-time (40 hrs. per week) temporary (May 1st – July 31st with some flexibility on start/end dates) research technician to assist with research projects related to the construction of selective fish passages. This position allows technicians to develop engineering skills and apply behavioral ecology to create means of controlling populations of invasive lamprey in the Great Lakes. We aim to design and test passages that will block lamprey access to rivers, while allowing native species to pass. 2026 projects will specifically investigate how turbulence and predation risk (via a chemical alarm cue) influence lamprey behavior and movement. 

Technicians will be engaged in testing selective fish passage devices by running behavioral experiments on sea lamprey in large indoor raceways. This will involve installing pit telemetry systems, configuring passage devices, implanting pit tags, observing and handling lamprey, preparing lamprey chemical cues, maintaining lab equipment, and data collection/analysis. Technicians may also have the opportunity to collaborate with Federal agency partners and other stakeholders. When working at Hammond Bay Station, housing will be provided nearby. 

Location: Hammond Bay Biological Station, Millersburg, Michigan 

Qualifications: Enrolled in or recently graduated from an undergraduate institution in the field of fisheries, ecology, biology, engineering, or a related discipline. Applicants must be comfortable handling animals and working in and around water. Our study species is nocturnal, so work will often take place at night, and requires technicians to lift up to 40 lbs. and spend long periods of time on their feet. Prospective technicians should work well in a team, but should be able to work independently as well, with a strong work ethic and positive attitude.

Job Description

* Applications are accepted electronically ONLY at www.cu.edu/cu-careers *

The Wunder Lab has openings for 3-4 temporary full-time Professional Research Assistant positions to begin 4/13/2026 until approximately 8/15/2026.

PRAs will form a 4-person field crew managed by PhD student Casey Weissburg (Project Lead). This is an exciting opportunity to conduct nest and brood monitoring for the Mountain Plover, a declining shorebird species, at two separate study sites in beautiful Colorado. Fieldwork will occur on the eastern prairies near Karval, CO, and in the high prairies of South Park, near Hartsel, CO. Work in Karval starts 4/13/2026 and in South Park mid-May and continues until mid- to late-August depending on start date.

The prairie landscape is beautiful but harsh, wide open with no shade. Temperature extremes range from near freezing in the early season morning/nights to 90-100 degrees F during the summer. Inclement summer monsoon weather (rain, lightning, hail) is a common occurrence. Work hours may be irregular, depending on storm activity, but typically include morning and late afternoon work with 2-3 hours off during the middle/hottest part of the day. Technicians will have weekends off. Lodging or free camping is provided at the study sites, but housing arrangements away from the study sites during off days are not provided.

Nest searching and resight surveys for a ground-nesting shorebird (50%)
Mountain Plover capture and banding (10%)
Radiotelemetry tracking of tagged chicks for brood monitoring (30%)
Data entry (5%)
Weekly arthropod sample collection (5%)

Qualifications you already possess (Minimum Qualifications)
Applicants must meet minimum qualifications at the time of hire.
Bachelor of Science in a natural resource-related field is preferred for all employees, but a combination of education and related technical/paraprofessional experience may be substituted for the bachelor’s degree.  

Preferred Qualification to possess (Preferred Qualifications)
At least 2 seasons experience working on wildlife-related field research projects.  
Previous experience with bird capture and handling.
At least one season of experience of nest searching for ground-nesting birds, and/or radiotelemetry.

Conditions of Employment
Work during the evening may be required depending on weather disruptions.
Work outdoors in the prairie means common hazards such as venomous snakes and thunderstorms.
Temperature extremes range from near freezing in the early season morning/nights to 90-100 degrees F during the summer. Inclement summer monsoon weather (rain, lightning, hail) is a common occurrence.
Employees will always have weekends off from work.

Physical Requirements
Most fieldwork will be conducted from ATVs but successful applicants should possess the ability to hike moderate distances over uneven terrain, sometimes in inclement weather (rain, hail, high winds).  
Plover nest searching and brood monitoring require the ability to visually scan grasslands with and without binoculars and the ability to hear bird calls and the radio signal of radio-transmitting tags during telemetry duties.

Description
 *Applications are reviewed on a rolling-basis.

ARS Office/Lab and Location: A research opportunity is currently available with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), located in Beltsville, Maryland.

The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.

The Adaptive Cropping Systems Laboratory (ACSL) at the USDA-ARS Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) in Beltsville, Maryland conducts integrated experimental and modeling research to understand how crops respond to key abiotic factors such as weather, soil conditions, and management practices. Our team designs and carries out controlled experiments and develops, validates, and applies advanced mathematical models to investigate a wide range of agricultural challenges, including the impacts of extreme weather on crop production, land suitability assessment, food security, on-farm resource management, and farmer competitiveness.

Research Project: Our stakeholders—including farmers and crop advisors—need clear, science-based guidance on how to manage farming operations in response to current and projected weather and soil conditions. We are seeking an intern to continue development of an existing web-based portable information delivery system (ID) that integrates on-farm data streams, ACSL crop and soil models, and weather forecasts. This toolkit is intended to provide in-season decision support, helping end users optimize site-specific farm management.

The participant will continue development of an existing IDS platform and support its deployment with end-users under the guidance of laboratory mentors. Activities will include computer programming related to database development, extension of the IDS graphical user interface, and integration of our crop and soil models. Database activities will involve capturing model-based scenario input and output data that can be queried in real time. The participant will also collaborate with on-site scientific staff to transition components of an existing Windows-based graphical interface into the new web-based IDS framework. Additional opportunities include exploring portable versions of our models and applying artificial intelligence methods to enable interaction through mobile platforms.

Learning Objectives: The participant will collaborate with an established multidisciplinary team with international expertise in crop and soil modeling, gaining knowledge about extreme weather impacts, and how crops and soils respond to genetic, environmental, and management inputs. The participant will develop new skills in computer programming and model application and will gain experience engaging with stakeholders in the development and use of decision-support technologies for agricultural systems.

Deployment of the web-based IDS during the participant’s term is expected to draw significant attention from crop consultants, scientists, and other agricultural stakeholders outside the laboratory. The participant will receive full credit for their contributions, including recognition as a co-principal investigator in the web-app contributors list. This visibility can help establish the participant as an innovative and impactful software engineer, potentially opening the door to additional high-profile opportunities.

The participant will also interact daily with world-class experts in agricultural modeling, agronomic science, and model-based decision support. These interactions will broaden their experience across multiple scientific disciplines and strengthen their confidence in developing innovative, stakeholder-oriented software tools.

Mentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is David Fleisher (david.fleisher@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: March 1, 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $64,000 - $110,000 annually.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

ORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.

Questions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process, please email ORISE.ARS.Northeast@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.

Qualifications
The qualified candidate should have received or be currently pursuing an associate's, bachelor's, master's, or doctoral in the one of the relevant fields.

Preferred skills:

Demonstrated self-starter with postgraduate level experience (BS or MS with 3 + years) in computer science / data science or related field with demonstrated experience in software engineering.
Selection factors include coding proficiency / experience in: API and front-end development (eg. HTML, CSS, JavaScript); programming languages (e.g. PYTHON); relational databases and query languages (e.g. SQL); testing/troubleshooting software programming using debugging tools; source control management (e.g. Git, TeamFoundation).

Description
Description: The Walters lab at the University of Wyoming and Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit is seeking applications for two (2) seasonal field technicians to assist with research on native aquatic species in a southeastern Wyoming prairie stream. Technicians will aid a graduate student with research focused on examining spatial and temporal variation in fish and mussel habitat use. Fieldwork will involve collecting fish, mussel, and habitat data at discrete mesohabitats (e.g., pool, riffle, run). This data will help identify habitat associations for each species to help guide future habitat improvement projects. Other duties will include gear maintenance, data entry, and additional work as needed.

The ideal candidate is highly motivated, detail-oriented, and possesses a strong work ethic and enthusiasm for fisheries conservation.

Description
WRC provides qualified internship applicants the opportunity to gain hands-on experience working with wildlife in our seasonal Mammal or Avian Nurseries. Nurseries are open from late March through late October; there are different sessions within that time frame available for interns depending on availability (see https://wrcmn.org/Wildlife-Internships-at-WRC/12/ for details).

College students, college graduates, or people just looking for a fun hands-on experience with wildlife are all welcome. Internship positions are unpaid and housing is not provided. Applicants must be 18 years or older.

Duties and responsibilities:
Commitment of 20-30 hours per week and 300 hours minimum to complete the internship. Interns are not working directly with veterinarians in the treatment room, however, upon completion of >400 hours of internship time, the intern may be considered for the veterinary shadowing program (one 2-3 hour shadow shift per week).
Working with wildlife requires some labor-intensive tasks, so you must capable of listing 30lbs, being on feet for 4+ hours, working in a hot and humid environment, bending down/sitting on the ground, and working in varying weather conditions
Follow all WRC policies and procedures relating to safety, personal protective equipment, biosecurity, animal care
Be dedicated to providing the best care possible to patients and maintaining the wild nature of patients
Work closely with volunteers by providing ongoing training and guidance
Admit new patients: Set up caging, prepare food, organize paperwork, and follow protocol
Prepare food for and hand-feed young patients, using a variety of techniques
Maintain caging with appropriate furnishings for a wide variety of species
Learn to recognize signs of illness and notify supervisor when there are concerns about a patient’s health
Administer medications (including injections
Maintain paperwork
Maintain laundry and clean cages; keep the nursery clean and orderly
Treat everyone including staff, volunteers, other interns with respect

Requirements
Our requirements for internships are fairly simple. You must, however, be very willing to do a lot of manual labor. Working with wildlife means a lot of cleaning and lifting. It means being on the ground while cleaning out cages and feeding animals. You'll be moving cages and large boxes/bags of food and you'll be working outside on and off throughout the day. This is a very labor-intensive, hands-on experience.

20-30 hours/wk for a minimum total of 300 hours/season
Available days, nights, weekends, holidays
Able to follow specific instructions
Minimum age of 18 years
Prior management experience or hands-on animal experience is desirable but not necessary

Description
 Overview

The Guam Department of Agriculture's Division of Aquatic & Wildlife Resources (DAWR) is looking for a Wildlife Biologist to add to the Wildlife Office team! DAWR is tasked with protecting Guam’s natural resources by working through partnerships to conserve and manage fish and wildlife and their habitats for the use and enjoyment of current and future generations. In particular, the Wildlife Office works closely with Guam's native bird and bat species, specifically the Guam rail (Ko'ko'), Guam kingfisher (Sihek), Micronesian Starling (Såli), Mariana swiftlet (Yayaguak), Mariana moorhen (Pulattat), and Mariana fruit bat (Fanihi). We also work to educate the public about invasive species such as the brown treensnake and the threats they pose to native wildlife. DAWR also collaborates with federal agencies and local environmental groups on conservation projects in pursuit of wildlife restoration on Guam.

Details & Responsibilities

This person will contribute to DAWR's monitoring of Guam's native bird and bat species. Avian monitoring methods include point count surveys, audio playbacks and recordings, camera trapping, nest monitoring, and radio telemetry. Bat colonies are monitored via roost counts and flyover surveys. The majority of work will take place in the field, primarily on Islan Dåno' (Cocos Island), a small islet off the southern coast of Guam (daily boat transportation provided) but also in other forest and watershed habitats across Guam. This will include species identification and monitoring, data collection, and maintenance of equipment and survey stations. Additionally, this person will be responsible for data entry and database management in the office, and will assist with data analysis and report writing.

Biologists also participate in public outreach events and classroom visits with trained education birds. On a limited basis, this person may also assist in husbandry for DAWR's captive breeding programs of Guam rail and Guam kingfisher. There may be opportunities for additional trainings and off-island travel for conferences and workshops.

Benefits

This is a full-time, permanent position with the Government of Guam and comes with full health care and retirement benefits, sick leave, holidays, and vacation hours. We will likely be able to provide some relocation assistance, such as a one-way plane ticket to Guam and a small sum for other relocation expenses, though we cannot guarantee this at this time.

Qualifications
 
Applicants must have graduated from a recognized college or university with a Bachelor’s degree in biology, wildlife science, fishery science, zoology or related fields. Applicants must also have a valid U.S. driver's license, and be prepared to work outdoors in Guam's hot, humid, tropical climate.
 
Preferred experience: 
· field experience in avian monitoring techniques 
· experience with ARUs, trail cameras, GPS, and radio telemetry 
· experience with basic statistical analysis and report writing 
· familiarity with Guam's ecosystems and species 
· the ability to work both independently and as part of a team 
· a strong work ethic, and a willingness to learn

Its primary purpose is to serve the original needs of the NGO’s operations which are wildlife conservation through research and education. This is accomplished through the layout of the farm which provides extensive wildlife habitat and foraging opportunities, increasing the local faunal biodiversity as well as acting as an educational demonstration to local subsistence farmers and visiting students.  
  Interns will learn by assisting in implementation and evaluation of management practices, cropping, and record keeping on the farm with this vision in mind while we endeavor to maximize the products coming from the farm with the existing design and layout using sustainable and regenerative practices specific to the Mesoamerican uplands. Within this broad framework, intern projects can include several basic Agricultural Education disciplines including Tropical Agriculture, Sustainable/organic Agriculture, Farm Management, Waste management, and Agricultural Economics.  
  In addition to planting crops, we also have free range chickens and ducks for eggs and meat. We are looking to increase our revenue generation from the farm either in the form of increased accountable products entering our kitchen for use in our restaurant, or for sale to the Mobile Market or in a proposed road-side café which would be managed by T.R.E.E.S kitchen and hospitality staff. Thus, interns would also assist us with our marketing strategy for existing products and/or planting. 
  By the successful conclusion of this internship, the student will be able to apply practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species, basic free range poultry operations, evaluate different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns, and become familiar with sustainable management practices such as no/low till, cover cropping, waste management, mulching, marketing, Farm-to-Table, etc. 
    Requirements: 
 No prior tropical agriculture experience required. Interns can be current undergraduate or graduate students enrolled in a program with their University/College for credit, however non-students can also apply; but preference will be given to students enrolled in an accreditation program. Experienced tropical agriculturalists and/or agroforestry professionals are also welcome and will be treated according to their experience level and are eligible for *discounted rates. 
    Internship Responsibilities: 
 Applying practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species and basic free range poultry operations. 
Evaluating different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns. 
Work on Inga Alley-cropping and other regenerative cropping practices, and using intercropping, organic fertilizing and pest control practices. 
Assist with innovative marketing strategies for existing products accompanied by reviewing projected budgets for the farm and their products and exploring cost/profit ratios for poultry husbandry. 
Planting and selling new products for the farm. 
Opportunities are also available to observe and participate with concurrent intern and wildlife educational activities such as mist-netting, observing and recording measurements of bats, birds, herps, invertebrates, water quality, and much more. 
Interns will assist with creating captions for social media posts to engage and update followers on what has been going on at the field station and various projects that are being done. 
     Costs: 
 The internship fee includes room and board (meals included Monday-Friday), full access to lab equipment, and training by professional on-site biologists. Food is a combination of self-catering in a communal kitchen with ingredients provided as well as prepared meals, depending on whether we have other groups on site. Lodging at the research center signifies a shared dormitory-style rustic cabins with other same sex interns. This comes with full access to other facilities such as showers, restrooms, and kitchen. The nature of this program allows interns to carry out most of the work independently after the training period is done. Fees do not include airport transfer, flights, travel medical insurance, or $100 USD visitor permit fee if remaining in country for more than 30 days.    
  We are hoping to expand our internship program beyond North America. Citizens from Latin America and the Caribbean will be charged at a discounted rate of 50%. Belizeans will get another discount. For more information, kindly email Scandia Cruz with the email provided above. 
    Schedule: 
 Interns are required to work for 35 hours/week minimum. The typical schedule runs from Monday through Friday, from 6:30 am until 12:30 pm and 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm. Weekends are free time for interns; therefore, you can do as please (travel, hike, relax). No refunds on food and lodging will be available if the intern decides to leave the station. Projects may sometimes run into the weekend; in which case the days will be returned to them during the week. The intern supervisor(s) will be responsible for designing a schedule with the intern each week that is reasonable and includes work on the various projects.

 Internship Opportunities 
Muscatatuck National Wildlife Refuge 

The mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System is to administer a national network of lands and waters for the conservation, management and, where appropriate, restoration of the fish, wildlife and plant resources and their habitats within the United States for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans. 

Position Duties 

Internship positions entail a wide variety of job responsibilities that will support the refuges’ land management goals. There are multiple biological surveys that interns conduct including weekly waterfowl population monitoring, water level measurements, acoustic bat monitoring, and grassland surveys. Interns will assist with upkeep of refuge infrastructure including weed eating and applying herbicide treatment to parking lots, guardrails, and around water control structures. Interns preform maintenance on trails, including trimming over-hanging limbs, removal of fallen trees, and overall trail conditions. To maintain proper hydrologic function of the refuge interns will remove beaver dams and debris from creeks and water control structures. This will entail hiking along creek edges and/or canoeing on the refuge. Possible additional duties include helping with public use events and assisting the maintenance staff and visitor services staff with various tasks, construction, or repair projects as needed. Throughout the internship there are also possible opportunities for assisting with geese and dove banding as well as completing the coursework to obtain a red card for wild land firefighting. 

Additional Information

The internships are unpaid, free housing and utilities are available with the intern working a minimum of 24 hours per week. With the internship being unpaid we do allow for interns to look for a part time job off refuge but require that a minimum of 24 hours per week be reached to stay in refuge housing. Interns can expect approximately 40 hours per week of work unless an alternate 24 hours schedule is arranged. The housing is comfortable. Typically, there are 3-4 people in the house, the house is co-ed; rooms will be separated by gender. The house is fully furnished and includes twin beds. It has a dishwasher, microwave, flat screen LCD TV with DVD player, two refrigerators, washer and dryer, 1 full bath and 1 half bathroom.  You must bring your own bedding (sheets, pillows, etc.). Our maintenance shops are across the street from the house and offer an additional shower and restroom, and another washer and dryer. 

 This internship is an excellent steppingstone to your future career. Many of our previous interns now work in Federal and State jobs, in non-profits like The Audubon Society and The Wild Turkey Federation, and many are employed in Academia. There is no specific requirement for course of study, however, the applicant must be a current college student or have recently graduated (within the past two years). Preference will be given to students who are majoring in the science field, e.g. biology, wildlife science, ecology, environmental science, botany, mammalogy or similar disciplines. The Refuge Manager reserves the right to terminate any position without justification. 

Applying 

The start date for this position is between 5/18/26 and 6/1/2026 with an end date of 8/7/26. The end date can be flexible if needed. 

For questions please contact Angela van Winden at angela_vanwinden@fws.gov or 812-522-4352. To apply, send a resume and 3 references to angela_vanwinden@fws.gov. Applications will be accepted until March 10th, applicants will be contacted to schedule a phone interview after March 10th and all decisions will be made by April 1st.

Description
Higher-Education Student Internship: Bat Conservation & Acoustic Monitoring (2026 John T. and Jane A. Wiederhold Foundation Bat Conservation Internship)
 Host Organization: The White Memorial Conservation Center, Inc.
Location: Litchfield/Morris, Connecticut, USA
Position Type: Paid internship (higher-education student)
Dates: May 18, 2026 – July 31, 2026
Compensation: $17.00/hour
Schedule: Target 40 hours/week, primarily weekdays with dawn/dusk work required.
Housing: Shared housing available
Supervisor: Research Director (direct supervision/mentorship)
 Internship Summary
This internship provides hands-on professional experience supporting an ongoing bat conservation monitoring effort. The intern will learn to operate passive ultrasonic acoustic recording devices, implement data management standards, and use industry-standard workflows to process and interpret acoustic files (including quality assurance/quality control and documentation). The intern will also participate in an ongoing monitoring effort examining the prey availability of emergent aquatic insects in relation to a little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) maternity colony, integrating prey monitoring with bat activity data.
 What the Intern Will Learn
By the end of the internship, the student should be able to:
Independently deploy and maintain passive acoustic monitoring equipment and document site variables.
Process acoustic recordings using established workflows (e.g., screening noise/low-quality files, running an auto-classifier, and conducting manual review as needed).
Contribute to an insect-prey monitoring dataset (collection, basic sorting/identification, biomass preparation/measurement, and data entry/quality assurance and quality control).
Produce professional outputs (clean datasets, short social media posts, and a brief end-of-season summary for a general audience).
Core Responsibilities
Bat Acoustic Monitoring (Primary)
Deploy, retrieve, and maintain passive ultrasonic acoustic recorders at designated monitoring locations.
Follow field protocols for microphone placement and vegetation clearance to improve recording quality (training provided).
Download, organize, and archive recordings using established file-naming conventions and metadata standards.
Assist with acoustic processing workflows, which may include:
 Screening/removing poor-quality files and background noise,
 Running an auto-classifier,
 Conducting manual vetting of select calls for quality assurance/quality control and flagging uncertain IDs for review.
 Emergent Aquatic Insect Monitoring (Primary)
Support insect sampling that pairs with acoustic monitoring nights (training provided).
Assist with collection methods used to characterize nocturnal insect availability (e.g., blacklight/UV trap approaches), with specimens retrieved the following morning.
Sort and identify insects to an agreed taxonomic level (often Order), support preparation for size-class measurements, and enter/manage results in shared datasets.
Data Stewardship & Communication (Throughout)
Maintain clean, well-documented datasets (field logs, metadata).
Use Microsoft Office and learn other platforms as needed for the position.
Draft short written summaries of progress or methods for a general audience (e.g., end-of-season summary, short internal memo).
Professional Deliverables (Grant-Aligned Outputs)
Because this internship is intended to deliver meaningful professional development outcomes, the intern will be expected to complete:
A tidy, well-documented acoustic dataset for the internship period (including a data dictionary and metadata notes).
A tidy insect-prey dataset segment for the same period.
A brief end-of-season summary (2–4 pages) describing methods, accomplishments, and recommendations for next steps.
Social media posts, newsletter articles, and other short communications delivered to the public.
Minimum Qualifications (Student-Focused)
Applicants should:
Be currently enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate program in biology, ecology, wildlife, natural resources, environmental science, or a related field.
Demonstrate serious interest in bat conservation and field-based ecological monitoring.
Be able to work in varied outdoor conditions, on uneven terrain, and around biting insects/ticks; early morning/evening work is required.
Hold a valid driver’s license and be able to drive a pickup truck (automatic; occasional 4WD/off-road).
Be able to work independently and as part of a team; collaborate respectfully with staff, volunteers, and the public as needed.
Preferred Qualifications
Prior experience with passive bat acoustics and/or insect sampling (helpful but not required).
Familiarity with ecological data collection standards and careful field note-taking.
Comfort learning structured workflows in acoustic analysis software (training provided).
Work Environment & Physical Requirements
Field + office role; office environment is non-smoking with moderate noise levels.
May occasionally lift/carry equipment (up to ~50 lbs).
Work includes outdoor hazards (poison ivy, sun exposure, uneven terrain, biting insects) and potential exposure considerations associated with wildlife work (training and safety guidance provided).
Application Requirements
A complete application includes:
Cover letter (required), including: 
A short statement (1–2 paragraphs) demonstrating serious interest in bat conservation and why you want hands-on experience with acoustic monitoring and data stewardship.
 Resume (required)
Two references (required), including: 
One academic advisor (name, title, email, phone)
One additional professional or academic reference

Description
Wichita State University is seeking four highly motivated technicians to assist in data collection for a collaborative research project investigating the response of plants, birds, and soils to different cattle grazing practices on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grasslands in Kansas and Colorado. Although grazing animals such as bison historically played an important role in native prairie, grazing is currently excluded or highly limited in many CRP sites related to native prairie. Our study will quantify potential conservation risks and benefits of cattle grazing on CRP sites located in tallgrass (Kansas) and shortgrass (Colorado).

Technicians will collect plant data in three-person sampling crews (two technicians and one lead graduate student or technician). Each crew will be responsible for sampling a subset of sites (36) in our areas of interest in Kansas and Colorado. Field work will require driving a few hours each day over paved and low maintenance (dirt, gravel) roads in relatively remote, rural areas. Duties include but are not limited to: collecting vegetation structural data, plant species abundance, and plant biomass; data entry and quality control; and equipment preparation and maintenance. Candidates must be willing to hike long distances into field sites through tall or short grass prairie while carrying equipment to reach sampling locations. Working hours will be spent almost exclusively in the field and involve early mornings, long hours when necessary, and maintaining motivation during variable weather conditions. Technicians must be able to transport themselves to field housing and be ready to begin training and orientation in mid-late May 2026. The field position will end by August 8th, 2026. Shared housing will be provided near field sites in rural Kansas (St. John or Stafford) and Colorado (Las Animas or Lamar). Rental vehicles will be provided for fieldwork transportation but drivers must be 21+ years of age. Technicians will be paid $17/hour with the possibility for time-and-a-half overtime pay.

Qualifications:

1)      Academic training in and/or enthusiasm for biology and/or ecology.
2)      Previous experience with plant identification preferred, but not required.
3)      Fit to perform and keep up field work while maintaining exceptional work ethic in a variety of conditions, including heat, humidity, rain, biting insects, and poison ivy.
4)      Eager to work in remote, rural settings for long periods of time.
5)      Good interpersonal skills and willingness to work and live with other technicians and interact positively with CRP landowners.
6)      Attention to detail and able to closely follow a detailed data collection protocol.
7)      Possess a valid driver’s license and willing to drive rental field vehicles on gravel and muddy roads.
8)      Must be available for the entirety of the field season ~mid/late May to August 8th, 2026 with little to no absences greater than 3 days (excluding illness).

Technicians will gain experience with plant identification and data collection techniques, interact with private landowners, and large-scale ecological research. To apply, email the following documents either as separate word documents or a combined PDF: 1) cover letter, 2) your CV/resume, and, 3) the names and contact information of three professional references. Please email these documents with the subject line “Summer Plant Ecology Field Technician” to Evalynn Trumbo at evalynn.trumbo@wichita.edu. Application review will begin February 2nd, 2026.

We are hiring up to six BICs to assist with the operations of our network of Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) banding stations, operated collaboratively with The Institute for Bird Populations (http://www.birdpop.org/maps.htm). Our MAPS program is supported by the Oil Sands Monitoring program, a collaborative initiative within Alberta Environment and Protected Areas that brings researchers together across a broad range of terrestrial biological monitoring. Program objectives are to understand the effects of oil sands development and the cumulative impacts of development on songbird populations. Under this initiative, our MAPS program includes banding stations near Conklin, Lac la Biche and Cold Lake, as well as near to and north of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The BIC would be responsible for the maintenance and operation of six remote MAPS banding stations. Positions would commence on May 20, and would extend through August 8, 2026. You would be expected to arrive in Fort McMurray on May 19, to begin training early on May 20. 
 Successful candidates must have advanced skills in mist-netting, bird banding, identifying, aging and sexing of landbirds in the hand, ability to identify birds by song, operation of a banding station, data management, and either hold or qualify to hold a CWS bird-banding subpermit. NABC certification and previous experience with the MAPS protocol would be very useful assets. The successful candidate would supervise, guide, and provide advanced training to their assistant on bird-banding, aging and sexing of birds, and banding station operations. Demonstrated leadership skills, attention to detail, adherence to safety requirements, and tolerance of long and sometimes difficult field days that begin before dawn, and an ability to supervise and maintain a healthy team atmosphere are required. Applicants must hold a current, valid driver’s licence (equivalent to Alberta Class 5), allowing them to drive (truck would be provided) in Alberta.
 BIC’s would be employees of OMEI and would receive payment of between CA$4,000 and CA$4,200 (less required deductions) per month (paid every two weeks), depending on experience. Food and accommodation would be provided. Successful applicants would have their travel paid or receive a travel allowance to offset the costs of travel to and from Fort McMurray. BIC’s would adhere to OMEI safety and industrial site requirements for working in this region, including government agency and client directives relating to pandemics, and would be required to pass a pre-employment Alcohol & Drug test. Safety training courses (e.g., First Aid/CPR, OSSA Basic Safety Orientation, Bear Awareness) would be provided. Upon completing the season adequately and responsibly and adhering to all required safety protocols, BICs would receive a lump-sum bonus of CA$2,500 at the conclusion of the program. No health or other benefits beyond those described herein would be included.
 Applications must include a cover letter, resume, and the name and contact information of three persons as references. Successful candidates must provide a driver’s abstract as well as an insurance agency letter (or equivalent insurance history document) that shows at least 3 years of previous vehicle insurance coverage to demonstrate a driving record that qualifies for coverage under OMEI’s vehicle insurance policy. International applicants must possess a valid Canadian work permit for the duration of employment, or a post-graduate degree in biological sciences (or equivalent) to qualify for a Canadian work permit. Additionally, international applicants must possess either a banding permit or sufficient experience to qualify for a Canadian banding sub-permit.

Description
Overview: Reintroducing carnivores has become a conservation priority to restore ecosystems, however, these efforts rarely include robust assessments on the likelihood of a successful restoration program, as well as an understanding of how repatriated species will interact with contemporary ecosystems. Once a thriving native species on Isle Royale National Park (Minong), lynx were extirpated a century ago. With growing interest in lynx reestablishment to Isle Royale, we have a unique opportunity to evaluate the implications of potential lynx restoration to the ecological integrity of Isle Royale National Park and the donor population on the adjacent mainland. This project proposes to build a scientific framework to determine whether reintroducing lynx to Isle Royale is feasible and beneficial for the island's ecosystem, as well as the donor ecosystem. Our framework is anticipated to be applicable to broader regional conservation goals for lynx and for carnivore reintroductions globally. 
 We are seeking one post-doctoral associate to evaluate i) Habitat Suitability: evaluate whether Isle Royale can support a viable lynx population; ii) Population Viability and Genetic Health: assess the long-term sustainability of a reintroduced lynx population, including the risks of genetic erosion; iii) Community Impacts: predict how lynx reintroduction will influence Isle Royale’s predator-prey dynamics and broader mammalian community. Simultaneously, we will examine the potential impacts on the mainland source population, on the Grand Portage Indian Reservation, to ensure minimal disruption. The Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa are culturally affiliated with Minong, the Anishinaabe place name for Isle Royale, and have practiced stewardship of natural resources on Minong and the north shore of Minnesota for millennia.
 To accomplish this work, we will leverage existing data and ecological modeling to map habitat suitability and model population dynamics on Isle Royale and in Grand Portage, simulate genetic and demographic scenarios for both island and mainland populations, and analyze the cascading effects of lynx reintroduction on the current ecological communities. This position will be based in the Pauli Lab (https://pauli.russell.wisc.edu/) in the Department of Forestry and Wildlife at the University of Wisconsin -Madison under the supervision of Dr. Jonathan Pauli. They will also work closely with biologists at Isle Royale National Park and Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. 
 The postdoctoral position is for 1.5 years.  The appointment will be as a research associate.  Salary is competitive and commensurate with experience, and health benefits are included.  The position is available immediately, and we seek to fill it by September 1st 2026, but a later start date is negotiable. Review of applicants will begin immediately, but the positions will remain open until a suitable candidate is found.  Applications received by January 31st are guaranteed consideration.
 Qualifications:  We seek candidates who work well in a collaborative setting and have excellent communication and writing skills.  Good English writing and verbal communication skills, as well as the ability to work in a team, are essential.  Candidates should have demonstrated skills in the processing and handling of datasets, especially as it relates to population and community dynamics of wildlife.  Applicants for the post-doc position must have completed their Ph.D. at the time of appointment and have published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  

To apply:  Please submit your application here:

Description
 The Great Basin Institute is an interdisciplinary field studies organization that promotes environmental research, education, and service through the west. The Institute’s mission is to advance applied science and ecological literacy through community engagement and agency partnerships, supporting national parks, forest, open spaces and public lands. 

The Ecological Monitoring Program at GBI serves as an excellent professional development opportunity for natural resource professionals looking for experience in botanical, soil, and rangeland surveys. This program focuses on the collection of reliable and consistent quantitative data on the status, condition, and trend of natural resources on public lands. GBI Ecological Monitoring Program partners with the Bureau of Land Management to acquire these data by implementing the Assessment Inventory and Monitoring (AIM) Strategy, a national program that sets rigorous standards for data collection for use across jurisdictions and agencies. Data collected documents changes in resource condition over time and informs decision making at the landscape scale.

The program supports conservation of the marine turtles (primarily Caretta caretta and Chelonia mydas) of the central Gulf Coast of Florida through the collection of fundamental biological data about nesting and hatching of sea turtles in a portion of Sarasota and Manatee Counties. The STCRP is a community-based program consisting of 5-7 staff members, 14-20 interns, and approximately 300 volunteers. The STCRP also works with agencies throughout the state to support conservation efforts for these federally protected marine turtles.

Intern Duties Interns participate in daily sea turtle nesting surveys that begin at dawn throughout nesting season (April 15 - October 31). During nesting surveys, participants walk the beach (or patrol by using an All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) at select locations), respond to, and document sea turtle activities. Once field work on the beach is completed, staff and interns return to Mote Marine Laboratory to perform office duties such as data entry, preparations for the next day, communicating with government agencies when required, scanning data sheets, painting stakes, and contacting STCRP volunteers for problem resolution and feedback. Interns also assist in informally educating the public about sea turtles, the hazards they face, and the proper actions humans should take when turtles are encountered. Specific field work activities are dependent on the time of the season, the degree of turtle activity and environmental factors, but in general, interns will be trained to do the tasks listed below: 
 •Identify false crawls and nests 
•Identify sea turtle species from tracks 
•Verify nests (dig to locate eggs) 
•Stake off new nests 
•Complete required data forms 
•Respond to depredations, washovers/washouts, or other activities that negatively impact nests 
•Respond to adult and/or hatchling disorientation events 
•Excavate hatched nests (inventory of nest contents) 
•Complete office tasks as previously described above 
 Interns will receive preliminary training by reviewing videos, slide shows, and manuals prior to the start of the internship. Once at Mote, interns will receive one-on-one training in the field and office. 

Field work can be strenuous, may require walking long distances in soft sand, and is conducted every morning of the season despite inclement weather. Daily temperatures will reach 90+ degrees for a significant portion of the summer. Humid conditions with frequent showers and thunderstorms are normal. Prolonged rainfall often occurs in connection with tropical disturbances or hurricanes. Hot, buggy, sandy, or wet conditions can be expected. 

A typical day begins at dawn and can be long and challenging, as each day presents variable conditions (such as storms) that can impact the workload. Interns often work on weekends, but they will have two consistent consecutive days off during the week. Obtaining a second job during the internship is not recommended due to the variability of the schedule and the heavy workload. 

The likelihood of interacting with adult sea turtles is rare, as they primarily nest at night and nesting surveys begin at dawn. Occasionally, a nesting female will still be on the beach in the morning, though it is rare. Interactions with hatchlings (live and dead) can be expected, though is limited for the protection of the turtles. 

Requirements 
College students or recent graduates that are responsible, adaptable, motivated to learn and with an attention to detail are encouraged to apply. This internship is an immersive, highly demanding, field-based role. We are looking for candidates who understand that reliability, dedication, and flexibility are critical to success and that maturity and professionalism are necessary when working with the public, STCRP staff members, and STCRP volunteers. 
 Specific requirements: 
•MUST HAVE A VALID DRIVER’S LICENSE AND DEPENDABLE VEHICLE. Interns are responsible for transporting themselves and field equipment to the various beaches and Mote. A bicycle is not an acceptable alternative. 
•A commitment to participate in the program for at least 10 weeks, though longer is preferred. 
•A minimum of 18 years of age and engaged in or recently completed undergraduate studies. 
•A background or degree in Marine Science/Biology/Ecology or related field preferred. 
•Field research experience preferred, but not required. 
•Ability to walk long distances in soft sand, handle high temperatures, humidity, and insects,withstand exposure to intense sunlight, and carry up to 30 lbs. 
 Benefits/Costs
Interns will be responsible for their own transportation to and from Sarasota and living expenses during the time of the internship. All selected interns will receive a biweekly (every other week) stipend of $200 to cover mileage incurred on the intern’s personal vehicle while performing internship duties. Interns must have a U.S. social security number in order to receive stipend payments. Additional need-based stipends are available from Mote Marine Laboratory. Applications can be found on the Mote Internship Application webpage (see below). The STCRP is not involved in the need-based stipend review process. Please note that need-based stipends are separate from the biweekly $200 transportation stipend.

 Our AmeriCorps positions provide impactful educational and service opportunities that benefit both communities and landscapes. SECC’s participants reflect the population of the Southeast region, including youth, graduates, veterans, and individuals from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. 
   Description of Duties 
The crew member position is an entry-level role. During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors in all weather conditions, performing heavy manual labor to complete conservation and restoration projects. Most projects require hiking out to remote work sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack. While prior experience with the outdoors or outdoor work can be helpful, it is not a necessity for this position. We ask that crew members embrace learning opportunities, face challenges, and build community with their crew. 
    Service Project: 
The crew will be based out of SECC’s office in Chattanooga, TN and travel to complete various conservation projects directly supporting Hurricane Helene disaster recovery efforts in the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest. The crew will collaborate with U.S. Forest Service land managers to complete conservation projects.    

In 2024, the southeast was impacted by Hurricane Helene, causing significant damage to trails and recreation areas within national forests. This crew will focus on repairing storm-impacted trails by constructing trail reroutes, restoring damaged tread, repairing bridges, re-establishing trail corridor, and logging out down trees. Trail maintenance will require use of carpentry and hand tools. During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors on rugged terrain in all weather conditions, often in remote wilderness areas, performing heavy manual labor related to conservation and restoration projects.  Most projects require hiking out to project sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack.  

Service projects vary depending on seasonal factors and safety considerations. While the staff at SECC and partners strive to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs. Tasks may include, but are not limited to:     

Repair and construct trail bridges and boardwalks    
Trail construction and maintenance    
ex. Water bars, drain dips, reroutes of sections of trail, fixing slope   
Corridor clearing   
Repair or install water structures along trails   
Log out trails impacted by fallen trees   
Invasive species removal
