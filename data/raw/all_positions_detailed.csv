Description
Title: PhD-level Graduate Assistantship in Fisheries Human Dimensions and Governance at University of Florida
Institution: University of Florida, School of Forest, Fisheries, and Geomatics Sciences; Program of Fisheries and Aquaculture Science
Salary: $32,000 stipend, plus full tuition waiver.
Project Description:
A multitude of studies globally have now documented shifts in the distribution of marine fishes and fisheries in relation to changing ocean conditions. Effective governance of natural resources--including fisheries--relies on engagement with, information from, and support by fishers and other stakeholders who are affected by changing management and environmental conditions. Understanding stakeholder perceptions, preferences, and knowledge can help us test theories of human behavior, describe more holistic pictures of fisheries, and improve fisheries management and governance. Drs. Chelsey Crandall and Edward Camp seek a PhD student to study stakeholder perceptions of changing marine fisheries socioecological systems along Florida’s Gulf coast. The successful candidate will apply a combination of qualitative and quantitative social science methods to understand and integrate the perspectives and experiences of managers and fishers connected directly with fisheries in the region. The position will involve (i) assessing perceptions via interview and survey instruments, including soliciting local knowledge from fishers to develop historical timelines of change from their perspectives; (ii) facilitating workshops and meetings with primary and secondary stakeholders; and (iii) assessing effects of co-production on stakeholder perceptions. This position is part of a larger interdisciplinary project that will knit together biological, ecological, socioeconomic, and integrated empirical and model-based assessments of changing marine fishery systems. As such, this position offers the opportunity for learning multi- and transdisciplinary skills and is intended to be part of a cohort of 3-5 students that will facilitate interdisciplinary learning. The project applies a knowledge co-production approach, bringing together scientists and end-users (e.g., fishers, managers) throughout to ensure that the products developed meet the information needs of decision-makers. This position is therefore expected to work with state and federal management agencies as well as recreational and commercial marine fishers. It will involve travel to various areas along Florida’s Gulf coast, but the student will be based in Gainesville, Florida.

Responsibilities and research topics
Primary responsibilities include:
Developing a theory-based research proposal with management application
Conducting qualitative and quantitative human dimensions research
Writing 2 or more peer-reviewed manuscripts describing research
Successful completion of required coursework and writing of accepted dissertation

Potential research topics could include:
Reviewing literature perceptions of changing fisheries
Testing theories of how beliefs and mental models change in response to shifting ecosystems
Evaluating factors that may explain and predict perceived changes
Assessing efficacy of co-production methods for improving fisheries governance.

Qualifications
An undergraduate degree in fisheries, wildlife ecology, natural resources, or a related field is required. A MS degree in fisheries, wildlife ecology, natural resources or a related field is preferred. Experience with scientific research and an interest in human dimensions research is required and demonstrated experience with human dimensions approaches such as developing and implementing surveys and/or interviews is preferred. The ideal candidate would have some experience with qualitative and quantitative analyses in R and be interested in intradisciplinary research to understand fisheries Governance.

Contact
To be considered for this position, please send (1) a cover letter describing your research interests and career goals, (2) a current CV describing relevant experience, (3) unofficial transcripts, and (4) contact information for three references, as well as any additional questions to Edward Camp at edvcamp@ufl.edu. Review of applications will be ongoing, but please submit application by November 1, 2025 for full consideration.

Description
Description: We seek applications for a PhD assistantship focused on the genomic basis of parasitic and non-parasitic ecotypes in Ichthyomyzon lamprey. Nonparasitic lampreys have repeatedly evolved from parasitic species that feed on the blood of fish hosts. This shift in life history represents a loss of a complex trait, where nonparasitic lampreys transition directly from larvae into reproductive adults without developing the apparatus or appetite for parasitic feeding. The goal of this project is to understand the genomic and developmental basis of parasitism versus nonparasitism in the silver lamprey (I. unicuspis) and northern brook lamprey (I. fossor), two closely related ecotypes with ongoing gene flow in the Laurentian Great Lakes. The selected student will lead a collaborative project with two primary components: 1) a common garden study in which full reciprocal crosses of Iu and If will be raised at the US Geological Survey’s Hammond Bay Biological Station (HBBS) in Millersburg, MI and sampled for transcriptomic and phenotypic analysis across key stages of larval development through metamorphosis into reproductive adults (nonparasitic If) or parasitic juveniles (Iu); and 2) a population genomics study in which whole genomes will be sequenced for groups of each species from multiple streams where they co-occur. These genomes will then be used to identify genomic regions that consistently differ between ecotypes. The selected student will lead all aspects of the project, including lamprey and sample collection, assessment of reproductive and trophic phenotypes, transcriptomic and genomic analyses, writing reports, and publishing results in scientific journals. Support and training will be provided by the PI (T Buchinger) and co-PIs at MSU (J Hume and Y-W Chung-Davidson), USGS (N Johnson), University of Manitoba (M Docker), and University of Glasgow (A Jacobs). The student may also have opportunities to develop other projects that leverage research facilities at HBBS and the Genomics and Chemical Ecology Laboratory at MSU.  
 Qualifications: B.Sc. or M.Sc. (preferred) in biology, evolutionary biology, bioinformatics, genomics, or a related field. Experience or interest in fieldwork, morphology, and bioinformatics. 
 Location: Primary location is MSU (East Lansing, MI) with regular sampling trips (~3 days each) to HBBS (Millersburg, MI), lamprey sampling throughout the Great Lakes region, and the opportunity for a visit (~3 months) to University of Glasgow (Glasgow, Scotland) to work with Co-PI Jacobs on analysis of genomics data. 
 Start date: March-June 2026.
 Stipend: ~$35,000/ year; health insurance and tuition waiver. Funding is expected for 4.5 years. 
 To Apply: Send a letter of interest including a brief summary of background and qualifications and a CV to Tyler Buchinger (buching6@msu.edu). 
 Review of applications will begin 17 Nov 2025 and continue until the position is filled.

Description
 The Ward Lab at Ball State University is seeking motivated graduate students to begin in Fall 2026. Current research in the lab spans three themes in behavioral ecology: 1) The social ecology of the nest in oviparous species, with a focus on embryonic learning and communication in the context of predator recognition; 2) the geometry and function of movement displays and the role of the lateral line system in social communication; and 3) the biological effects of multiple human-mediated environmental stressors across ontogeny (embryo, larval, and adult stages). These themes reflect the lab’s broader, long-term goal of understanding the development, function, evolution, and behavior of animals in aquatic ecosystems. Students with interests in behavioral development, learning, social interactions, communication, sensory ecology, or conservation and behavior are especially encouraged to apply. 
 Student funding is available through a variety of sources, including departmental teaching assistantships. The Ward Lab is housed in the newly constructed, LEED-certified Foundational Sciences Building at Ball State University, which offers state-of-the-art research and teaching facilities. The Department of Biology fosters a collaborative and dynamic environment with 30 faculty members and approximately 45 graduate students. Ball State University is located in Muncie, Indiana, on an attractive and welcoming campus about 45 miles northeast of Indianapolis. 
 
 Prospective students should contact Dr. Jessica Ward at ward@bsu.edu. Please include (i) a letter of motivation, including a statement of your research interests and relevant technical skills and experience; (ii) a CV; (iii) unofficial transcripts; (iv) contact information for 3 academic references; and (v) a scientific writing sample. For MS applicants, a working knowledge of statistics is preferred but not required. For PhD applicants, please note that the successful prior completion of an MS degree is required for admission to the PhD program. For best consideration, please apply as soon as possible. Applications will be reviewed as they are received.
 
 To learn more about admissions requirements and processes, applicants may visit the University graduate admissions webpage (https://www.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/gradschool).

Williams National Coral Reef Management Fellowship program is a partnership between Nova Southeastern University’s National Coral Reef Institute, NOAA’s Coral Reef Conservation Program, the U.S. Department of Interior Office of Insular Affairs, and the U.S. Coral Reef All Islands Committee.

The program recruits Coral Reef Management Fellows for the seven U.S. coral reef jurisdictions (American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Florida, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) to address current capacity gaps and to build longer-term capacity in these locations. This is done by placing highly qualified individuals whose education and work experience meet each jurisdiction’s specific coral reef management needs. The program’s goal is to develop a thriving collaborative fellowship program that builds excellent next-generation leaders and capacity for effective local coral reef ecosystem management.

Prospective applicants may apply for more than one jurisdictional position, but a separate application must be submitted for each position. Prospective applicants should note that this is a management and policy-focused fellowship, and that SCUBA diving will not be permitted.

Description: We are seeking one M.S. student with an interest in upland bird communities to conduct a 2-year study assessing distribution and habitat associations of prioritized bird species in upland hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood systems of the East Gulf Coastal Plain.  The study will take place on private or publicly-owned forest sites in parts of western and northern Mississippi, and possibly southwestern Tennessee or northern Alabama. This will be a new study that will focus on establishing baseline distribution and abundance of priority species for upland hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood systems identified in the East Gulf Coastal Plain Joint Venture landbird plan. The student will also collect data on forest structure and surrounding landscape conditions to establish habitat associations in these systems. Field work under this study will take place late Spring-Summer 2026 and 2027 and may include auditory/visual bird surveys, exploration of Autonomous Recording Units as a survey mechanism, and comprehensive forest overstory and understory cover surveys. The extent of field work will depend on availability of funds. The student will interact closely with partners in the East Gulf Coastal Plain Joint Venture, which represents an active partnership among federal and state wildlife agencies, non-profit organizations, and others with an expressed dedication to bird conservation in the region. If interested, the student will also have the opportunity to evaluate alignment of field-based forest structural metrics with satellite-based LiDAR measures to improve the ability for extrapolation of LiDAR data to applied forest management needs. The student will also be part of the Quantitative Ecology and Spatial Technologies Lab (https://www.quest.fwrc.msstate.edu/) at Mississippi State University, which is a is a research consortium of spatial and quantitative ecologists dedicated to the management and conservation of wildlife from individuals to communities and their associated landscapes. The position will require strong quantitative skills and strong field skills, along with the ability to work and think independently. The position will also require strong writing skills for proposal and thesis/publication development.  Data will be used to help inform/update desired forest structural conditions for birds in upland hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood systems. Field housing will be provided on or near sites. Per requirements of departmental funding, the student will be required to serve as a Teaching Assistant in one departmental course each semester, except for their graduating semester.

Qualifications: B.S. degree in wildlife and fisheries science, biological sciences, forest ecology, natural resource science, conservation biology, or other related fields with GPA >3.0.

Description
Description: Biocultural approaches to conservation improve the stewardship of biological and cultural diversity by recognizing the dynamic and interconnected relationships between Peoples and the natural world. In fisheries management, these relationships are often overlooked, meaning that current approaches rarely integrate diverse knowledge systems or perspectives. This PhD project funded by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission and the Great Lakes Fishery Trust will address this gap by building a shared understanding of the relationships between Peoples and Adikameg (Anishinaabemowin for Lake Whitefish, Coregonus clupeaformis) and by identifying biocultural indicators to track the health of the fish and communities they support. The student will work alongside Indigenous fishers, stewards, and knowledge holders from up to six partner Nations and Tribes. They will conduct ethnoecological fieldwork to document the relationships between people and Adikameg, including the cultural significance of the species across different communities. They will organize discussions and workshops to share knowledge with project partners and conduct a regional ethnoecological review. The goal is to determine the role of Adikameg within the biocultural heritage of the Great Lakes and assess how its decline affects the cultural integrity of Indigenous communities. The student is expected to spend significant time in partner Nations and Tribes near Lakes Michigan, Superior, and Huron. They will work closely with community-based researchers and scientists from Tribal Nations, Carleton University, and the University of Vermont.

Qualifications: Candidates must have a B.Sc. or M.Sc. in ethnoecology, anthropology, ecology, fisheries, geography, conservation, or a related field. They should have experience working with communities and rightsholders to co-produce knowledge and be familiar with qualitative and/or quantitative methods. Strong writing, communication, organizational, and leadership skills are essential, as is the ability to work independently and as part of a team. We encourage applications from individuals of all backgrounds. When qualifications are comparable, preference will be given to Native Peoples of the Great Lakes Region and other Indigenous Nations in recognition of the importance of Indigenous leadership in this work. 

To apply: Send a one-page cover letter describing your strengths and why you believe this position is the right fit for you, a two-page CV, a writing sample (500 – 750 words), unofficial transcript, and two references to Thaïs at thais.bernos@uvm.edu. Submit documents as a single PDF file named “[your last name]_Adikameg.pdf”. 

Key details: Start date is preferably January or May 2026, but we are open to later start dates for the ideal candidate. This position will be funded for four years (~35,000 / year + fringe benefits) through research assistantship and teaching assistantships. 

Location: The F.I.S.H. lab is located within the historical territory of the Western Abenaki, at the Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources (University of Vermont). We do interdisciplinary work focused on understanding and becoming better stewards of fish diversity, from genes to ecosystems. Being a fishery scientist means that we are taking a political side: therefore, we strive to reflect and be transparent about why we ask (and don’t ask) specific scientific questions, how we answer them, who we work with (students, communities, First Nations, or no one), and how we work with them. Our lab is on the shoreline of beautiful Lake Champlain in Burlington, VT.

Join me to learn the three proven factors you need to get a permanent job in wildlife, ecology, zoology, or conservation biology careers so that you can: 
Do what you love
Truly make an impact, and...
GET PAID!

I’m Stephanie Manka, Ph.D. (formerly Schuttler), a wildlife biologist with 20+ peer-reviewed publications who has been conducting research and working across different wildlife professions and workplaces around the world since 2003 (https://stephanieschuttler.com/about-me/). I’ve been hired, hired others, seen many others get hired, and now teach aspiring wildlife professionals like you what it takes to get a job through my proven 3-part framework. 

I’ve learned what it takes to get a job, wrote the book on “Getting a Job in Wildlife Biology,” and now teach this so that you can streamline your career path, stop second-guessing yourself, and ensure you do get the job you dream of. My students have secured permanent jobs, field assistant positions, internships, graduate assistantships, and more all over the world (https://stephanieschuttler.com/swptestimonials/). 

Which of the following applies to you?
Applying and applying for jobs, internships, and even volunteer positions, but rarely or never getting interviews
Graduated with a degree related to wildlife, but are in a job that isn’t using it
Feel stuck, lost, confused, or unsure of your next steps in pursuing a career in wildlife
Getting started in your career in wildlife, know it’s your dream, but don’t know how to do
Worried about the competition you constantly hear about
Feel like you just can’t stand out in a sea of intense competition
Feel like you don’t have enough experience or aren’t good enough for permanent jobs

If you found yourself nodding your head yes to even at least one of these, then this free training is for you! 

Here’s a sneak peek of what you’ll learn:
The 3 essentials you need to get a permanent job
The things that employers care about most when it comes to getting a permanent job
Where to put your focus when applying for jobs in wildlife 
How to go about planning your path in the wildlife field
Where most people go wrong in wildlife careers and why they aren’t succeeding
How to solve the most common struggles that aspiring wildlife professionals face
And more!

If you’re an aspiring or struggling wildlife professional who knows they are destined to be in this career and can help wildlife, but are not where you want to be in your career or are unsure how to do it, this training is for you!

This free training has already started, but there is still plenty of time to join us and catch up. Live sessions #2 and #3 are on October 14th and 16th, and the replay of training #1 is available.

Description
Earth’s lower atmosphere is a critical yet understudied ecological habitat. Trillions of organisms live, forage, and migrate through this vast aerial environment—yet it is rarely treated as a primary habitat for ecological or conservation prioritization. Despite its perceived lack of structure, the airspace serves as a global conduit for the movement of biomass, weather, and inorganic materials. Increasing pollution and the proliferation of human-made structures are rapidly transforming this habitat, underscoring the urgent need for fundamental research to address core questions in population and community ecology.

This PhD project in the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources at Purdue University (https://ag.purdue.edu/department/fnr/index.html) aims to understand how airspaces are ecologically organized by examining species occupancy, niche structure, predator–prey dynamics, and morphological adaptation. The lower atmosphere tightly links distant terrestrial and aquatic systems through the transfer of biotic and abiotic resources, forming a rich but largely unseen network of organisms.

Aeroecology, the study of airborne life and its use of the lower atmosphere, offers a unique lens for exploring these dynamics. Using aerial insectivores, specifically Purple Martins, as a model system, this work will test three complementary hypotheses grounded in community ecology:

1.     Niche Packing Hypothesis – How do species partition aerial space and resources?
2.     Morphology-Driven Niche Hypothesis – How do traits shape the ecological roles of airborne species?
3.     Tracking Aerial Resources Hypothesis – How do species follow and respond to the movement of aerial prey?

By integrating radar and barometric pressure transmitters with ecological theory, this project will reveal the organization and dynamics of communities that inhabit our planet’s aerial ecosystems, offering transformative insights into one of Earth’s last unexplored habitats.

Qualifications: The candidate is expected to have completed a master’s degree in a related field (Biology, Ecology, Wildlife Ecology) prior to starting the position in August 2026. The student should have experience in R coding, geospatial analysis, avian ecology, bird handling and banding, comfort deploying radio tags (or similar technology), and a record in disseminating research findings, including presentations and peer-reviewed publications. 
 To Apply: Please send your application to Kyle Horton (kghorton@purdue.edu) containing a Cover Letter, CV, and contact information of three references.  Within your cover letter, please reflect on how your experiences lend to this project, why you are interested in this project, and how this degree helps fulfill your career aspirations. Send your materials with the email subject title “Insectivore Airspace GRA”.

· Must be willing to work alone in inclement weather without cell service, communicating via radios and satellite communication devices.
· Must be able to navigate on and off-trail using topographic maps and a hand-held GPS or OnX.
· Must have good communication skills and the ability to interact professionally with hunters, MI DNR biologists and staff, landowners, recreators, other technicians and volunteers, and the supervising graduate student.
· Must be detail-oriented, organized, and have data management skills, as well as a demonstrated ability to follow directions including strict field protocols.
· Must possess a valid driver’s license and have a clean driving record.
· Patience, adaptability, stamina (mental and physical), respect for others, professional behavior, and a positive team-player attitude are important.
Preferred Qualifications
· Experience working and/or living with people or groups from differing backgrounds.
· Experience safely operating 4WD trucks on snow, sand, and gravel roads and hiking on and off-trail through rugged terrain in remote locations.
· Prior experience using/setting up/repairing hair snares.

Testimonial

“Last summer, DJ&A offered me an internship out of their office in Vancouver, WA. They enabled me to travel to a new city and state, all while providing an excellent internship. I was able to hone industry-specific skills in AutoCAD, gain hands-on experience working in the field, and to talk to professionals throughout the company. At the end of the internship, I left with applicable skills, a better understanding of the civil engineering industry, and ultimately a full-time job as a Design Engineer and Construction Inspector at DJ&A’s Missoula office after graduating!”

Description
 The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is a continental-scale observation facility funded by the National Science Foundation and operated by Battelle. The NEON program is designed to collect long-term, open access ecological data to better understand how U.S. ecosystems are changing, from freshwater systems such as streams, rivers, and lakes to terrestrial systems spanning tropical forests to deserts to tundra (neonscience.org). We depend on our people to collect observational data and samples, to monitor automated instrumented systems that collect terrestrial and aquatic data, and to operate our airborne observation platform that captures remote sensing data of regional landscapes and vegetation. 

Job Summary
We are currently seeking a Field Ecology Intern. This position is an onsite role located in Vancouver, WA. This position will start in May 2026 and end in August 2026.

If you can't choose between the mountains and the ocean, the Pacific Northwest (Domain 16) may be the place for you. This coastal Domain features spectacular mountain ranges, vast conifer forests, and a rugged, rocky coastline. The NEON field sites, nestled into the Cascade Mountains of Washington and Oregon, offer an opportunity to see how different land management strategies impact this unique temperate ecosystem. NEON sites in the Pacific Northwest Domain are managed from our Vancouver, WA office.

Field Ecology Interns perform seasonal and periodic sampling of physical, chemical, and biological data at one (1) to multiple field sites (depending on location), while exercising good judgement and decision-making abilities to interpret protocol requirements. This position may be assigned an area of primary responsibility within the scope of data collection: botany, soils, entomology, mammalogy (except Puerto Rico and Hawaii), limnology (except Hawaii), or instrumentation; the position may also be assigned multiple areas of responsibility as a “generalist”.

Field observations and collections are conducted using approximately 30 different protocols and may include NEON Research Support Services projects with varying schedule requirements based on local ecosystem and field conditions

Individuals are responsible for their own housing and transportation to primary work location. 

Physical Demands and Work Environment

The work involves walking, hiking, prolonged standing, bending, and kneeling. Heavy items, equipment and packs up to 40 pounds, must be lifted and carried on a routine basis. Field work includes exposure to extreme temperatures, inclement weather, rough and variable terrain, stinging and biting insects, and wildlife hazards. Instrument maintenance involves performing work on instrument towers ranging in height from 24 feet to 240 feet, which includes ascending and descending multiple flights of stairs. Driving off-road in 4WD vehicles is required. Travel to field sites requires several hours of driving daily on city streets, high-speed highways, winding and steep canyon roads and unmaintained gravel/sand roads using 4WD.

Work Schedule and Travel 

We have a dynamic work environment where schedules are variable at the manager’s discretion. Generally, employees work 40 hours per week, with workdays ranging from 8-10 hours per day. Occasionally, workdays may extend to 12+ hours per day, including split shifts, starting before dawn and/or ending after dusk, and weekends. The ratio of field to lab work is about 75% field and 25% office and lab duties.

It is important to note that working over 40 hours a week may be required as needed, and overtime will be paid accordingly. Additionally, frequent overnight travel (e.g., monthly for 3-4 nights) is required. Travel may be even more frequent 

Responsibilities
Perform field and lab assignments in a variety of conditions (e.g., weather, terrain, diverse assigned biomes, etc.).
Follow established, standardized field procedures for sample collection; record data from sample collection in handheld tablets, computers, etc.; equipment preparation and maintenance, process and ship samples.
Navigate to field sites and sampling locations.
Report activities and completed work according to protocol.
Follow safety policy and procedures.
Report issues with implementation of procedures and coordinate resolution.
Assist with routine administrative duties, special projects including Research Support Services collaborating with external Principal Investigators and other duties as assigned.
Key Qualifications
Currently pursuing undergraduate or advanced graduate degree in ecology, forestry, environmental or related scientific field.
Ability to learn and perform procedures and methods outside of the primary responsibilities. 
Excellent verbal and written communication and interpersonal skills. Ability to follow written and verbal instructions. 
Effective problem-solving skills and the ability to organize and execute multiple activities and priorities.
Ability to proactively identify and resolve resource conflicts. 
High level of attention to detail and accuracy 
Ability to work independently and as part of a team.  
Demonstrated optimism in adverse conditions and good judgement in identifying, mitigating, and avoiding hazards. 
Ability to identify good practices and areas for improvement in team performance. 
Valid U.S. Driver’s License with acceptable driving record pertinent to the position.  
Ability to successfully pass background checks and pre-employment drug testing.
Must be a U.S. Citizen. 

Salary
Pay rate: $15.00-$17.00

This information reflects the anticipated base salary range for this position based on current national data. Minimums and maximums may vary based on location. Individual pay is based on skills, experience, and other relevant factors.
