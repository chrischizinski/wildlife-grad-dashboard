Description
Mountain ecosystems are among the regions most susceptible to temperature warming, and species adapted to alpine ecosystems are predicted to face local extinctions via physiological and/or behavioral intolerance to rapid increases in temperature. Persistence of alpine avifauna will depend upon the ability of individuals to seek out microhabitats that provide cool refugia while engaging in behaviors that reduce energy expenditure. Identifying such microclimate refugia and understanding how alpine birds use them will help inform management strategies for conserving alpine ecosystems in the face of rapid temperature warming. This funded PhD project focuses on two focal species, Rock Ptarmigan and Rock Partridge, using state-of-the-art GPS tracking technology to quantify fine-scale movement patterns, as well as climate monitoring at study sites and land surface temperature mapping using a thermal drone. The project is located in the Swiss Alps and has completed two field seasons, with fieldwork projected to continue for an additional 1-2 years. 

The successful PhD Candidate will have access to the full study data set, with the opportunity to develop new field and/or analytical components depending upon logistics, expertise and interest. The Candidate must hold a MSc degree in biology or equivalent and ideally will show a strong interest in conservation science, environmental management and spatial analyses. 

Additional preferred (but not required) skills include: field experience studying birds or other vertebrates in montane landscapes, strong quantitative background with ability and interest to rapidly gain new skillsets related to the joint analysis of animal movement, climate, and remote sensing data, and knowledge of French and/or German. 

The project will be co-advised as a collaboration between Prof. Dr. Raphaël Arlettaz at University of Bern Division of Conservation Biology (Switzerland) and Assistant Professor Dr. Ian Ausprey at Texas A&M University Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology (USA). The Candidate will spend the first year at Uni Bern and the second two years at Texas A&M University and must be willing and able to commit to this schedule (exact timing negotiable). The PhD will be defended and granted at Uni Bern. 

Start: January 2026. Duration: 3 years, with possible prolongation. Salary according to SNSF rules. 

Applications must be submitted to ian.ausprey@ag.tamu.edu and should include a motivation letter describing your interests, experience and relevance for this position, a CV (including a list of publications if available), abstract of MSc thesis, and contact information for three professional references (institution, email, and phone number).

The application deadline is September 7th, 2025, with online interviews during the second half of September 2025.

Description
 The Wildlife Restoration Foundation (WRF) Bear Conservation Specialist-Glacier Country (GC) position is open to qualified individuals passionate about bears and ideally based in/near Kalispell or Missoula in Montana near Glacier National Park. The position is part volunteer, but stipends are available to cover expenses and to reward accomplishments after proven results over a trial period. The GC Bear Conservation Specialist will rapidly gain valuable professional experience and connections by playing an exciting, integral role on the WRF team. Work to build WRF’s bear conservation capacity and impact on Yellowstone area bears as you contribute and strengthen your conservation knowledge and skills. Gain recognition for your efforts among area partners, on the WRF website and elsewhere, as you participate visibly in meeting WRF’s mission, which is to increase park wildlife population viability both ex situ and in situ, working closely with National Parks and Forests, state wildlife and tourism agencies, Tribes, zoo partners, and park gateway communities. 
 WRF operates effectively and efficiently and generates resources that enable measurable, boots-on-the-ground conservation results. The WRF Bear Conservation Specialist for Glacier Country Northwest (GC) will focus on implementation of the “I Am Bear Safe” Project in Bigfork, Columbia Falls, Coram, Hungry Horse, Kalispell, Lakeside, Somers and West Glacier and possibly other towns that are Glacier’s gateway communities. The GC Bear Conservation Specialist will collaborate with the WRF President, Beary Program Director/GC Project Coordinator, and other team members, as well as partnering chambers of commerce and Glacier National Park and possibly Tribes in connection to the “I Am Bear Safe” Project. [https://www.wildlifeandparks.org/projects]. 
 “I Am Bear Safe”™ (IABS) is a multi-partner WRF Collaborating with Wildlife Strategy designed to equip National Park gateway community chambers of commerce and their member businesses (“Park Gateway Partners”), as well as Tribes, to “train people not to train bears” to get in the trouble they are in now because of human behavior—a situation that is assuring bear demise. Bears are a top attraction at many National Parks and are well-managed within the parks to avoid human interaction. But communities at the park’s edge are not often sufficiently prepared or equipped for the increasing pressure of more visitors coupled with rapid development, naïve new residents, and a growing number of recreationists in bear country. Park Gateway Partner (PGP) businesses are the perfect intervention point and receive marketing benefits from participating in the IABS town-based bear stewardship effort. WRF provides customized tools (signage and SWAG) that equip PGPs to effectively intercept park visitors and recreationists and equip them to be bear stewards who act responsibly by securing attractants and following park and Tribal rules for recreating in bear habitat. The IABS goal is that bears perform their natural behaviors and survive without risk and distraction caused by humans while supporting the economic benefits to park gateway towns from responsible tourism and recreation. 
 Responsibilities: 
·         Track the inventory of IABS Toolkit (signage) items needed by and distributed to PGPs in each town. 
·         Distribute IABS Toolkt materials to PGPs and redistribution points. 
·         Recruit new PGPs, as appropriate and assigned. 
·         Field questions and relay PGP concerns to WRF. 
·         Attend meetings of the chamber of commerce or local partner organization and events on occasion. 
·         Help keep IABS Management Database up-to-date for GC towns 
·         Use creative ways to stimulate Bear Quiz-takers. 
·         Come up with novel ideas to make the IABS Project more effective. 
 Education & Experience 
Bachelor’s degree in relevant subject is required; graduate degree helpful.
Knowledge and experience specific to grizzly and black bears preferred.
Experience working with community-based organizations and/or local businesses required. 
Outgoing nature and proven to be self-motivated.

 

WRF Bear Conservation Specialists are asked to participate in an initial (virtual) training then designate 16 hours a week to WRF and agree to work with WRF for 4 months. The GC Bear Conservation Specialist must be a self-starter, ambitious, creative, productive, and dedicated to WRF’s mission. S/he must also exhibit a high degree of professionalism, accountability, and ability to follow instructions and manage time well. S/he should be friendly and approachable, well-spoken, bold, and personable.  The position is initially unpaid, but stipends can be provided for approved expenses and as results are achieved. 

The Bear Conservation Specialist will report to the WRF President. Hours are flexible within the week, with the exception that PGP recruitment, Tools deliveries and communications best occur during Monday-Friday business hours. Participation in biweekly IABS team meetings and occasional full WRF team meetings by Zoom are required.

 

To apply: Please send a short (less than one page) cover letter and resume (maximum 2 pages) with references to info@wildlifeandparks.org. Please name the (single, if possible) electronic file as follows: [Date]_BearCS-GC_[Your Name].

BASIC SUMMARY

Sanibel Sea School is part of the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation (SCCF) family. The mission of SCCF is to protect and care for Southwest Florida's coastal ecosystems. Reinforcing this organizational purpose is the mission of Sanibel Sea School: to improve the ocean’s future, one person at a time. We are one organization with the united mission of improving, protecting, and caring for nature.
 Our campus is located on the east end of Sanibel Island, on the Southwest coast of Florida. Experiential educational offerings include day classes, non-residential summer and winter camps, paddling and outdoor education activities, after-school, homeschooling, private excursions, and outreach programs for the local community. Sanibel Sea School works with all ages, but the primary audience is 6 to 13. 
 We are a small staff, extremely passionate about the ocean and our work; we strive to offer exceptional customer service and education to each client. We are dedicated to the growth of our students and staff and strongly believe in the value of experiential education in nature. Learning outdoors builds self-confidence, encourages trust, and ignites curiosity and wonder. Our goal is simple: through exploration and discovery, we want to help children fall in love with the ocean and become lifelong advocates for the environment. We are also committed to being a diverse workplace and strongly encourage applications from underrepresented groups in marine and environmental sciences.
 Marine Science Educators are vital in delivering experiential educational programs to diverse age groups, from 4-year-olds to adults, both in the field and classroom. Their passion for marine conservation, love for the ocean, and expertise in marine science will inspire our students to connect with the natural world and become advocates for its protection. If you are an energetic, passionate educator with a love for marine science and a commitment to fostering a deeper connection between children and the ocean, we would love to hear from you. Join our dedicated team, and let's inspire future ocean stewards together!

Position/Project Specifics: 
Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC), in partnership with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, is seeking one highly motivated individual to assist with a long-term regional monitoring program focused on assessing coastal salmonid abundance trends in Mendocino County, California. This full-time seasonal position will begin on September 16th, 2025, and run through the end of May 2026, with a typical work schedule of four 10-hour days per week, though occasional weekend and holiday work will be required.

The successful candidate will take a leadership role in planning, scheduling, and conducting spawning ground surveys, while training and mentoring fisheries technicians to consistently uphold strict field and safety protocols, fostering a safe and efficient team environment. This role includes managing rotary screw traps, fyke nets, adult migrant weirs, traps, and counting structures.
