Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNWRS) located in Wenatchee, Washington.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: The PNWRS Lab in Wenatchee, Washington has a six-decade history of collaborating with eastern WA National Forests to develop geospatial scripts and tools that characterize forest vegetation conditions and changes occurring over the 20th and 21st centuries and expected changes in conditions and disturbance processes over 21st century. Together the Forests and the Lab also build decision support tools that support a Forest-wide strategies to create healthy and wildfire adapted forests and a toolkit for evaluating current conditions and adapting them to wildfires and warming.

This project creates updates in a landscape evaluation toolkit, which include new models for listed and sensitive species. These models can inform managers during planning on how to improve forest health and reduce adverse consequences to sensitive species. Revisions also include updating values in the existing models that reflect new science and lessons learned over the last 15-years. The toolkit also includes evaluation tools that show current wildfire risk, overly dense forest conditions, and opportunities for transitioning forest conditions that are adapted to 21st century wildfires and drying environmental conditions through management.

Learning Objectives: The fellow will develop professionally while engaging in research-operational partnerships and learning about systems involving forest composition, structure, insect and disease vulnerability, and fuels and fire emissions. They will gain experience with modeling, coding, and database management in support of a complex workflow. The fellow will gain valuable experience in decision support science while improving existing tools. The fellow will collaborate with others at the USDA Forest Service, Okanagan-Wenatchee National Forest and will have the opportunity to improve professional collaboration and communication skills.

Mentor: The mentors for this opportunity are Brion Salter (robert.salter@usda.gov) and Dr. Paul Hessburg (paul.hessburg@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $60,000 - $75,000 annually.

Description
The Wolf Conservation Center (WCC) is seeking one to two part-time technicians to support a behavioral research project focused on captive red wolves. This project is a collaboration between the WCC, Utah State University, and other Saving Animals From Extinction (SAFE) program facilities.

Technicians will assist a graduate student researcher by coding video footage of red wolf breeding pairs using BORIS behavioral analysis software. Footage was recorded during the 2025 breeding season (January–March). Each assigned wolf pair requires 20 minutes of coded footage for every day of recording. Technicians are expected to process approximately 8 days' worth of footage per workday to stay on schedule.  The goal is to assess how pair bond strength and individual behaviors relate to reproductive success in captivity.

This is a remote position. Technicians will use BORIS and R Studio to randomly select and code footage. The expected workload is 20 hours per week, with complete flexibility to set your own schedule as long as project milestones are met.  The duration of the position will depend on how quickly the footage is coded; hiring multiple technicians may significantly shorten the overall timeline.  Applicants must be comfortable working independently and spending long hours reviewing video footage.

Minimum Qualifications:

• Have or be working towards a degree in wildlife ecology/management, zoology, biology, natural resources, or a similar field
• Demonstrated attention to detail, precision, and consistency in observational tasks. Technicians will be responsible for thoroughly understanding and correctly applying an ethogram supplied by the graduate student researcher
• Proactive and self-directed, with the ability to structure a remote work schedule that aligns with project requirements
• Strong organizational and data management skills, with the ability to maintain a consistent file structure and follow detailed protocols. Technicians must manage large volumes of footage, including unused files that may be incorporated later
• Must have a computer or laptop capable of running R studio and BORIS behavioral analysis software
Preferred Qualifications:

• Background in ethology, behavioral ecology, or related biological sciences
• Familiarity with BORIS behavioral software
• Experience distinguishing between conspecific individuals with minimal sexual dimorphism
• Comfort working independently in a remote location

To Apply: Please send a cover letter, resume/CV, and contact information for three references as a single PDF to S. Lovin at s.lovin@usu.edu with “LastName – Breeding Behavior Technician 2025” in the subject line.  Label your file as“LastName_FirstName_BreedingBehaviorTechnician2025.pdf”. Applications will be reviewed starting 22 July 2025.

Start date is flexible, but priority will be given to applicants who can start by 4 August 2025.  Technicians are expected to commit to 20 hours of work per week.  This is a remote position, allowing a flexible schedule.  After training is completed during the first two weeks, technicians will be responsible for managing their time appropriately to ensure the project’s needs are met.
Estimated end date may vary depending on the number of technicians hired—additional personnel could accelerate completion.

Technicians will assist a graduate student researcher by coding video footage of red wolf breeding pairs using BORIS behavioral analysis software. Footage was recorded during the 2025 breeding season (January–March). Each assigned wolf pair requires 20 minutes of coded footage for every day of recording. Technicians are expected to process approximately 8 days' worth of footage per workday to stay on schedule.  The goal is to assess how pair bond strength and individual behaviors relate to reproductive success in captivity.

This is a remote position. Technicians will use BORIS and R Studio to randomly select and code footage. The expected workload is 20 hours per week, with complete flexibility to set your own schedule as long as project milestones are met.  The duration of the position will depend on how quickly the footage is coded; hiring multiple technicians may significantly shorten the overall timeline.  Applicants must be comfortable working independently and spending long hours reviewing video footage.

Minimum Qualifications:

• Have or be working towards a degree in wildlife ecology/management, zoology, biology, natural resources, or a similar field
• Demonstrated attention to detail, precision, and consistency in observational tasks. Technicians will be responsible for thoroughly understanding and correctly applying an ethogram supplied by the graduate student researcher
• Proactive and self-directed, with the ability to structure a remote work schedule that aligns with project requirements
• Strong organizational and data management skills, with the ability to maintain a consistent file structure and follow detailed protocols. Technicians must manage large volumes of footage, including unused files that may be incorporated later
• Must have a computer or laptop capable of running R studio and BORIS behavioral analysis software
Preferred Qualifications:

• Background in ethology, behavioral ecology, or related biological sciences
• Familiarity with BORIS behavioral software
• Experience distinguishing between conspecific individuals with minimal sexual dimorphism
• Comfort working independently in a remote location

To Apply: Please send a cover letter, resume/CV, and contact information for three references as a single PDF to S. Lovin at s.lovin@usu.edu with “LastName – Breeding Behavior Technician 2025” in the subject line.  Label your file as“LastName_FirstName_BreedingBehaviorTechnician2025.pdf”. Applications will be reviewed starting 22 July 2025.

Start date is flexible, but priority will be given to applicants who can start by 4 August 2025.  Technicians are expected to commit to 20 hours of work per week.  This is a remote position, allowing a flexible schedule.  After training is completed during the first two weeks, technicians will be responsible for managing their time appropriately to ensure the project’s needs are met.
Estimated end date may vary depending on the number of technicians hired—additional personnel could accelerate completion.","org

Description
 Description

The Great Basin Institute will recruit and support an Administrative Historian who will complete a new administrative history for John Day Fossil Beds National Monument (JODA). The historian at JODA will engage in researching and writing a comprehensive history of how JODA has been managed from 1996 to the present day, including important issues in planning, land acquisition, development, public relations, and other topics of ongoing management concern. The final narrative reference will consist of a scholarly examination of the administrative history of the unit and will serve as a valuable tool for future park managers and scholars. The research effort resulting from this project will significantly expand the site’s reference and archival files and provide additional information for park staff. Finally, the administrative history will be placed on JODA’s website to make the information widely available to the public.
A chronology of land acquisitions, paleontology research, archaeology surveys, park developments, special programs, resource protection and mitigation, and personnel changes are necessary to conduct many aspects of everyday park operations as well as in preparation for the Park’s 50-year anniversary in 2025. There has been a high degree of turnover at the Park recently. As such, there has been a great deal of loss of institutional memory. Having a new administrative history will help capture institutional knowledge and prevent further loss. The historian will create a published scholarly, and comprehensively updated report bridging the gap between the last administrative history report, in 1996, and the present. This report will be a substantial aid in the documentation of the history of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.
Description:
The updated administrative history will include photos and graphics as well as a comprehensive assessment of primary and secondary sources in local, regional, state and national archives.  Oral history interviews will be conducted with present and former NPS staff, park partners, volunteers and others. These interviews will require travel to meet individuals both within the commuting distance of the park and outside of it. The study will be prepared by a professional historian who meets the Secretary of the Interior’s standards for historians and follows the guidelines outlined in Director’s Order 28.
Project Objectives:
This project will result in a published scholarly, and comprehensively updated report bridging the gap between the 1996 report and the present and will be a substantial aid in the documentation of the history of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. This historic report will research and document cultural resources of the park from 1996 to present and is a baseline document. As appropriate, data from this research and the archive of the 1997 administrative history will be added to the park archives and entered into MCMS, and copies of the finished product will be added to the park’s library as well as disseminated to other appropriate areas. A PDF copy will also be made available through the IRMA database for wider access.
Project milestones include review of previous Administrative History, interviews with current JODA staff, identifying former JODA staff to interview and pertinent oral history questions to ask, gathering of archival data, and the synthesis of the final report. The historian will have monthly meetings with the JODA site supervisor to evaluate progress.
Location:
John Day Fossil Beds NM is situated in the John Day River Valley and surrounding lands. There are three separate units (Sheep Rock, Clarno, and Painted Hills) which are between one and two-hour drives away from each other. The area of paleontological interest consists of over 10,000 square miles cooperatively managed by the NPS, BLM, and USFS. Elevation in the region varies from 1,500 feet to 9,000 feet. Vegetation includes sagebrush/bunchgrass steppe, junipers, and forests of firs, ponderosas, and aspens. Weather in summer tends to be hot and dry with little precipitation and high temperatures regularly exceeding 100 degrees F. The area is remote and rural, with several nearby towns (population <200 people) and more distant towns of several thousand. Limited grocery shopping options are available in smaller towns near the monument (~10 miles distant), but the nearest grocery store, pharmacy, and hospital are about 45 miles from park headquarters (Sheep Rock Unit). More facilities and services are available in the Bend area which is about 120 miles from the Sheep Rock Unit. The closest airport is in Redmond, OR, about two-hour drive from the Sheep Rock Unit. Other airports are in Boise, ID, Pasco, WA, and Portland, OR.

Description
*Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) within the Pacific Southwest Research Station (PSWRS). This project is based at three long-term ecohydrological research sites (Soaproot, Newt Creek, and Providence), which are managed by the PSWRS of the USDA FS in the Sierra Nevada.

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

Research Project: The participant will engage in field-based research examining the impacts of wildfire and drought-induced tree mortality on water quality and quantity in headwater forest ecosystems.

The participant will collect water and gas samples from boreholes, soils, and streams, with a focus on capturing spatiotemporal variation in hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to disturbance. Specific activities will include participating in field campaigns to monitor moisture dynamics, collecting and analyzing water samples for major ions, nutrients, water stable isotopes, and carbon isotopes, and assisting in the maintenance and calibration of field instrumentation.

Laboratory activities will involve preparing and analyzing samples using techniques such as ion chromatography and isotope ratio spectroscopy. The participant will collaborate closely with graduate students and project collaborators to synthesize results, compare site responses, and contribute to research on how forest structure and climate extremes shape water availability and watershed function.

Learning Objectives: This opportunity will provide training in hydrologic instrumentation, sample analysis, and environmental data interpretation, supporting the agency’s mission to advance science-based forest and water resource management.

Mentor: The mentor for this opportunity is David Dralle (david.dralle@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

JOIN US!
Come join a growing team of conservation professionals at the Xerces Society who are dedicated to protecting some of the world’s most important animals. We are seeking a skilled and collaborative expert in invertebrate conservation, who has an interest in helping federal Farm Bill conservation programs work for monarch butterfly, pollinator, and beneficial invertebrate conservation in Texas. The ideal candidate should have direct experience working with the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, and be knowledgeable of Farm Bill conservation programs, such as EQIP, CSP, CRP and ACEP. The ideal candidate will also have a strong background in the conservation of monarch butterflies, pollinators in general, or other important invertebrate species, including those that serve as food for wildlife or that help in pest control. 

At Xerces, we harness the knowledge of scientists and the enthusiasm of the public to implement conservation programs. We take action by helping farmers, ranchers, and public agencies develop conservation plans for pollinators and beneficial insects, producing ground-breaking publications on invertebrate conservation, training thousands of farmers, ranchers and land managers to protect and manage habitat for beneficial insects, protecting endangered species and their habitat, and engaging the public to raise awareness about valuable invertebrates. 

WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING: 
This position is a partnership with the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service’s (NRCS) State Office in Temple, Texas. In collaboration with Xerces Society Program staff and regional monarch conservation partners, the Partner Biologist will help develop and implement conservation strategies for monarch butterflies. This position will create and update tools and conservation program technical guidance to help NRCS field staff evaluate and plan habitat. These tools may include habitat evaluation guides, habitat specifications, restoration guidance, plant lists, and guidance on managing rangelands for native plant diversity to benefit monarchs and other pollinators. The person in this position will organize and provide trainings and follow up support to NRCS staff and working lands partners on how to use this guidance consistently in order to plan impactful projects. The Partner Biologist will also help the Xerces Society and NRCS Texas better understand monarchs by conducting field research to better understand monarch migration dynamics and critical plant materials in Texas.

ESSENTIAL JOB FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES:  
Work with Xerces Society and NRCS specialists to develop or refine technical documents that support establishment, enhancement, or management of habitat for monarchs and other beneficial insects. Technical documents may include habitat evaluation guides, conservation practice specifications, plant lists, seed mixes, fact sheets, and habitat restoration guidelines. 
Train and support NRCS conservation planning staff in the use of these technical documents. 
Assist NRCS conservation planners in the development and implementation of conservation plans that create or enhance monarch, pollinator or beneficial insect habitat on working lands in southern Texas, but ranging elsewhere in Texas as needed.

Working Conditions: 

Work setting, including hazards: Field: The incumbent will assist with the collection of fish or invertebrates from boats and along the Puget Sound shoreline. This may include living on a boat for up to a week at a time. The incumbent will be subjected to inclement weather, including rough seas that may induce motion sickness. Shoreline sampling of mussels may occur along rocky and muddy shorelines at night in remote areas. The incumbent may lift heavy objects such as ice-filled coolers and baskets of fish on the deck of a moving boat. Fish handled by staff may possess sharp and venomous spines and may bite. The incumbent will assist with deploying and retrieving sampling nets from a boat or shore. This position may involve working in or near water, including tasks that require navigating, negotiating, and performing duties related to water environments.

Lab: Work will involve sitting or standing at a lab bench while performing repetitive, sometimes tedious dissections of fish and invertebrates for long periods of time. Dissections and sample creation may occur in a mobile laboratory set up on a boat or an off-site location but mostly will occur at the NRB Marine Resources Lab. The incumbent may also haul frozen samples in and out of a walk-in freezer and may handle chemicals including formalin, alcohol, and various acids. Use of sharp instruments such as scalpels, knives, and syringes is required.

Schedule: Standard business hours are Monday – Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., but the incumbent may be expected to adjust the work schedule to meet field sampling requirements.  A flexible work schedule will be considered at the incumbent’s request, subject to supervisory approval.

Travel: Travel is required at infrequent intervals to attend meetings or to conduct fieldwork.  This work requires driving long distances throughout western Washington, sometimes at night.  During field surveys, the incumbent may spend up to 5 days away from home on a boat or in motels.

Tools and equipment: Duties require the use of lab equipment (e.g., scalpels, syringes, meat grinders), field gear (PFDs, waders, botts, raingear) and field equipment (e.g., small boats and outboard motors, beach seines, lampara seines, etc.)

Customer interactions: Frequent contact (likely weekly) with various representatives from local, state, federal agencies, tribes and non-governmental organizations, as well as the occasional interactions with public (e.g., recreational fishers).
 

Qualifications:

Required Qualifications: 

Option 1: Bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university with major coursework in one or more of the following areas: Ecology, Environmental Chemistry, Toxicology, Natural Resource Science, or closely related field and three (3) years of professional experience in Fish management/research, Ecology, or environmental monitoring.

Option 2: Associate’s degree from an accredited college or university with major coursework in one or more of the following areas: Ecology, Environmental Chemistry, Toxicology, Natural Resource Science, or closely related field and five (5) years of professional experience in Fish management/research, Ecology, or environmental monitoring.

Option 3: Two (2) years as a Fish & Wildlife Biologist 2

In addition to the requirements above, the incumbent will have experience in/with the following: 
Designing, planning, and implementing field or laboratory studies

Working Conditions: 

Work setting, including hazards: Field: The incumbent will assist with the collection of fish or invertebrates from boats and along the Puget Sound shoreline. This may include living on a boat for up to a week at a time. The incumbent will be subjected to inclement weather, including rough seas that may induce motion sickness. Shoreline sampling of mussels may occur along rocky and muddy shorelines at night in remote areas. The incumbent may lift heavy objects such as ice-filled coolers and baskets of fish on the deck of a moving boat. Fish handled by staff may possess sharp and venomous spines and may bite. The incumbent will assist with deploying and retrieving sampling nets from a boat or shore. This position may involve working in or near water, including tasks that require navigating, negotiating, and performing duties related to water environments.

Lab: Work will involve sitting or standing at a lab bench while performing repetitive, sometimes tedious dissections of fish and invertebrates for long periods of time. Dissections and sample creation may occur in a mobile laboratory set up on a boat or an off-site location but mostly will occur at the NRB Marine Resources Lab. The incumbent may also haul frozen samples in and out of a walk-in freezer and may handle chemicals including formalin, alcohol, and various acids. Use of sharp instruments such as scalpels, knives, and syringes is required.

Schedule: Standard business hours are Monday – Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., but the incumbent may be expected to adjust the work schedule to meet field sampling requirements.  A flexible work schedule will be considered at the incumbent’s request, subject to supervisory approval.

Travel: Travel is required at infrequent intervals to attend meetings or to conduct fieldwork.  This work requires driving long distances throughout western Washington, sometimes at night.  During field surveys, the incumbent may spend up to 5 days away from home on a boat or in motels.

Tools and equipment: Duties require the use of lab equipment (e.g., scalpels, syringes, meat grinders), field gear (PFDs, waders, botts, raingear) and field equipment (e.g., small boats and outboard motors, beach seines, lampara seines, etc.)

Customer interactions: Frequent contact (likely weekly) with various representatives from local, state, federal agencies, tribes and non-governmental organizations, as well as the occasional interactions with public (e.g., recreational fishers).
