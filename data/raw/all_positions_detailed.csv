MSc, predictive phenomics to improve oyster aquaculture 

Department of Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Science, Coastal Oregon Marine Experiment Station, Oregon State University, Newport, Oregon

We are seeking one graduate student (MS) to work in collaboration with academic and federal partners to determine early predictive traits of product success. This project will leverage an ongoing selective breeding program of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. 

Predictive phenotyping or ‘phenomics’ seeks to improve efficiency with which desirable traits (i.e. survival, biotic/abiotic tolerance, etc.) are detected, as grow-out using standard cultivation methods is both labor and time intensive.  Streamlining discrimination of advantageous traits can accelerate and economize the progress of aquaculture breeding programs.

The student will execute experiments in a functional oyster hatchery and collect specimens to quantify catalysts, metabolites, and products of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in whole organisms and homogenized tissues. Facilitated by mentorship of the academic advisor, the student will be responsible for data management and analysis (using open-source notebook and data repositories), biannual presentation of project progress and findings at industry-centered conferences, and submission for peer-reviewed publication. 

A general background in cellular biology and bioenergetics is required. Candidates with prior benchwork, research, and/or commercial industry experience (oyster farm, hatchery, etc.) are preferred. 

A tentative start date for winter term 2026 advised by Dr. Samuel Gurr.

Required Qualifications: 

- B.S. in biology, marine science, aquaculture, or related field

- GPA minimum 3.0 (>3.5 preferred)

- Enthusiastic, motivated, and self-sufficient

- Strong verbal and written communication skills 

- Experience in basic laboratory techniques, good organizational skills, and attention to detail 

- Ability to work independently and as a productive member of a research team 

Preferred Qualifications: 

- Experience in both sterile benchwork and wet lab environments for the handling and processing of biological samples 

- Adept in following, troubleshooting, and writing iterative standard operating procedures for complex tasks

- Experience programming in R (data carpentry, statistics, visualization)

- Experience using version control systems for data management

- Background or interest in selective breeding, energetics, and evolutionary genetics

- Experience working in/or communicating with aquaculture industry 


Start Date: Winter or Fall 2026 

Application Deadline: open until filled

To Apply: Please send the following materials via email to Samuel Gurr (samuel.gurr@oregonstate.edu) 

(1) Cover letter describing qualifications, career goals, and academic interests

(2) CV with contact information for three references

Description
The Laverty Lab in the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Ecology and the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences at New Mexico State University invites applications for a Ph.D. position supported by research and teaching assistantships. The successful applicant will be hired as a graduate student position beginning in January 2026.

This project will be focused on assessing the roles of temporary water sources—playas (i.e., ephemeral lake beds), tinajas (i.e., natural bedrock depressions that are spring- or precipitation-fed), etc.—on structuring aerial vertebrate communities in the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts using acoustic monitoring. While the distribution of aquatic organisms is tightly associated with water features, terrestrial species may only visit water a few times each week to drink or hunt for prey. Among terrestrial vertebrates, highly mobile, aerial species (i.e., bats and birds) may provide information on the quality of individual water sources as well as the use of and connectivity among dispersed sources. Many bats and birds remain active in the Southwest year-round where the role of highly ephemeral water sources in structuring their communities is only somewhat understood. Activity of these aerial vertebrates at times when playas or tinajas lack water can reveal insights into the function of these sites beyond water drinking and may inform how a species would be expected to respond under a changing climate. The student will develop exciting questions investigating how bat (and potentially bird) activity and diversity interact with ephemeral water sources in desert landscapes.

This project is funded through a combination of graduate research assistantships supported by the National Science Foundation’s Long-Term Ecological Research program and the National Park Service’s Southwest Border Resource Protection Program as well as teaching assistantships in the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Ecology. Research will involve collaborative efforts with other university researchers and state/federal agencies. Benefits include an annual salary range of $28,384.56 – $29,698.32, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance.

Qualifications:
Required: B.S. in wildlife science, biology, conservation ecology, or related field. As you may work on a U.S. military base and make research trips to Sonora, applicants must be a U.S. citizen and possess a valid U.S. driver’s license and valid passport. The successful applicant must also meet the minimum requirements for admission to the NMSU Graduate School (minimum 3.00 GPA). Applicants should also have demonstrated excellent written and oral communication skills, and an ability to work independently. Applicants should have experience working in the backcountry and are willing to lead field crews in rugged, desert terrain in the Jornada Basin (New Mexico) and areas in/adjacent to Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument (Arizona), including El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve (Mexico).

Preference may be given to applicants with an M.S. degree in wildlife science, biology, conservation ecology, or related field and with a GPA of 3.30 or higher. Successful candidates will have experience working in R, an interest in acoustic ecology, and working with large datasets. They should also demonstrate the ability to work as part of a team and have a willingness to lead field work crews. Applicants with experience in processing acoustic data and statistical analyses are encouraged to apply.

The Laverty Lab is committed to providing a place of work and learning free from discrimination and harassment and encourages applicants from diverse backgrounds.

How to apply:
For consideration, please submit your application using the form on the following link: https://airtable.com/app22ZC66GEtCTx19/shruXqT6iFNwLazdy

Description
MSc/PhD Assistantship Conservation Genomics and documentation of snake fungal disease in Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake, Timber Rattlesnake, and Plain-bellied Watersnake 
 Department of Natural Resource Ecology and Management, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa 
 We are seeking one graduate student (MS or PhD) to work in collaboration with partners investigating the conservation genomics of three snake species of conservation concern and documenting the occurrence of snake fungal disease (SFD) in the Upper Midwest. The PIs are equally interested in either MS or PhD candidates for this position and preference will be given to the most qualified candidates seeking either degree. This project will facilitate collaborative conservation of at-risk snakes in three Midwestern states (Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin).  
 Habitat loss, population isolation, persecution, and wildlife disease are considered the major threats to snake populations.  Development of the landscape for intensive human use beginning in the 19th century (e.g., expansive agricultural and urban development) fragmented and isolated wildlife populations, especially species with limited dispersal abilities such as snakes. More recently many snake species have been threatened by an emerging disease caused by a fungal (Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola) infection (Snake Fungal Disease; SFD).  This combination of threats continues to impact snake populations in the Midwest.  The species targeted in this project are each considered at-risk in one or more of the partnering states.

Description
This one-year position, open only to US citizens, will involve organizing and participating in biweekly field expeditions for Ekipa Fanihy (ekipafanihy.org) with one additional tech (also from the US) and a team of Malagasy PhD students from the University of Antananarivo. This position will take over from one of our outgoing techs and overlap a current tech who will remain through August 2026 and be replaced in September 2026.

Ekipa Fanihy carries out capture and sampling of Madagascar's fruit bats (Pteropus rufus, Eidolon dupreanum, and Rousettus madagascariensis) at roost sites in the District of Moramanga, Madagascar, with possible extensions to field sites elsewhere. This work supports a long-term field study aimed at deciphering the mechanisms underpinning persistence of potentially zoonotic RNA viruses in wild, Madagascar fruit bats. Bats are reservoirs for several important, highly-virulent zoonoses, including rabies, Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, and SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses. This work also contributes data to population viability analyses and assessments of the conservation status of threatened fruit bats in Madagascar. Please see the Brook lab research page (brooklab.org/research) for further details about the major themes of the project.

Field technicians will be trained in the field in January 2026 by the Brook lab manager, Martin Roland, and and one current technician on the job, then supervised remotely (from UC Berkeley) for the duration of the year, interspersed with regular visits from Dr. Brook and other members of the Brook lab.

Techs will spend approximately 70% of their time in the field. During each field mission, techs will travel with University of Antananarivo PhD students for up to 1-2 days to remote field sites in vehicles with hired drivers. While in the field, the team will reside in tents provided by the project for up to two weeks at a time. The work will necessitate strenuous hiking and hauling heavy equipment, sometimes in adverse weather conditions. During field missions, a local cook will be hired to prepare meals, and all expenses (including food) will be funded by the project. 

While in the field, the field team will capture bats, collect biological samples (blood, urine, feces, saliva, ectoparasites, wing punches), and undertake basic sample preparation (i.e. centrifugation) and storage in liquid nitrogen. The work will be unevenly paced with periods of intense work interspersed with significant downtime; techs will need to be prepared to entertain themselves during this downtime with reading, writing, personal research projects, studying Malagasy, etc. Many field missions will overlap traditional weekends, and techs will be expected to work during these periods.

In between field missions (30% of the time), techs will live in a shared house in Madagascar's capital city of Antananarivo (housing includes a modern kitchen, ample living space, modern bathroom, WiFi, on-site security, and monthly cleaning services). Each tech will be provided a private bedroom. In Antananarivo ('Tana'), the techs will work with Ekipa Fanihy to further treat, organize, and conduct basic molecular analyses (DNA/RNA extractions, PCR, etc.) of samples at our laboratory at  Madagascar Biodiversity Center (www.madagascarbio.org). Together, the two field techs will be additionally responsible for restocking, packing, and preparation of field supplies for recurring field missions. When weekends overlap with periods of time in the city, techs will have free time to travel locally, take Malagasy lessons, and reset as needed.

When not in the field, techs will additionally have opportunities to take part in professional development in the form of remote lab meetings with the Brook Lab at UC Berkeley, as well as receive guidance on the graduate school application process if desired. Field technicians will be acknowledged on publications arising from this work and may or may not be included as co-authors depending on the duration of their employment and the extent of their intellectual contributions to data analysis and interpretation after the field work concludes. Opportunities for independent work--either in science communication or in research--may be pursued on a case-by-case basis.

Please visit our Brook lab news (brooklab.org/news) page to read prior field technician Katherine McFerrin's blog post, summarizing ""A Day in the Life of a Field Project Manager"" to read what life is like for our team in the field: brooklab.org/news/day-in-the-life. Feel free to reach out to contact former and current Ekipa Fanihy field technicians, Monique Ades (mnades06@gmail.com) or Martin Roland (martincroland@gmail.com), with any questions about the job.

Description
 *Applications will be reviewed on a rolling-basis.

USDA Forest Service Office/Lab and Location: A fellowship opportunity is available with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (USFS) within the International Institute of Tropical Forestry (IITF), located in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 

At the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.

The intention is to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations, as stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. The IITF is headquartered in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, and its mission is to develop and disseminate scientifically based knowledge that contributes to the conservation of forests, wildlife, and watersheds of the American tropics in the context of environmental change.

Research Project: The project fellow will assist in a project that addresses gaps in knowledge of the location and distribution of endemic Caribbean tree species. Using geographic information system methods and tools, research analyses aim to generate regional population size estimates, incorporate land cover and vegetation change maps, geological/environmental variables, and data on endemic tree species to identify locations of high abundance of endemic tree species across the three main archipelagos of the Caribbean (Lucayan, Greater and Lesser Antilles). 

The project approaches include integration of spatially explicit environmental variables including climate, hurricane disturbance, geology and land-use, among other global and Caribbean regional drivers with species distribution models. The project fellow would conduct research and analyses on Caribbean endemic tree species.  The project will use data from permanent forest plots and other sources, focusing on the various Caribbean forest types in the Lucayan, Greater and Lesser Antilles archipelagos. Development of analyses and maps identifying areas with high concentration of endemic species, quantifying land cover and endemic species richness, and other analyses describing forest composition, endemic tree species identified for agroforestry, wood resources, and non-timber uses (fruits, fibers, etc.,), are a goal of this research project. Further project goals are to broadly map endemic species based on land cover to support conservation assessments and management actions in the Caribbean region. The project will address the need to assess the distributions and potential conservation status of tree species as important elements of biodiversity, cultural heritage, and other ecosystem services. 
 Learning Objectives: The research fellow will have the opportunity to participate in processes for documenting, organizing, and integrating botanical, geological, climatic, and other environmental data sets. The project will also provide opportunities to learn about forest ecology, forest types, land cover change, species distributions, species ecosystem services, and hurricane disturbance dynamics in Caribbean forests. The fellow will have the opportunity to present analyses and quantitative map outputs in workshops, seminars, reports, and peer-reviewed publications developed and co-authored with mentors and collaborators. The fellow will have ample opportunities to share communications of outputs in various platforms that are expected to serve to inform knowledge of local and regional plant taxonomy, and species distributions for Caribbean tree species.  
Mentor: The mentors for this opportunity is Tamara Heartsill-Scalley (tamara.heartsill-scalley@usda.gov) and Eileen H. Helmer (eileen.helmer@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.

Anticipated Appointment Start Date: January 2026.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.

Appointment Length: The appointment will initially be for six months if full time but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.

Level of Participation: The appointment is part time or full time.

Participant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. Current monthly stipend for this six-month opportunity is $6,000 for a postdoctoral scientist, based on full-time participation. Health, medical and dental, insurance reimbursement up to $547 per month.

Citizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.

Title: Decision support modeling of environmental flows for Rio Grande Silvery Minnow

Agency: New Mexico State University

Location: Las Cruces, New Mexico (remote work arrangements may be considered)

Job Category: Post Doctoral Appointments

Salary: $63K-70K/year (DOE) with annual raises and benefits

Start Date: As soon as possible preferred, but negotiable

Last Date to Apply: Applications will be reviewed as they are received and the position will remain open until a suitable candidate is found

 Description:
The USGS New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit invites applications for a postdoctoral researcher position to join a multi-agency partnership focused on recovery of the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow. Once abundant throughout the Rio Grande and Pecos rivers, minnow populations are now restricted to the Middle Rio Grande and threatened by a combination of water extraction, river regulation, and drought. Population dynamics are strongly linked to hydrology, and managers are interested in strategies to manage minnow populations in average or dry years when declines typically occur. Managers are interested in evaluating alternative strategies for where, when, and the amount of water to be released while balancing the needs of other water users and staying in compliance with the multi-state (Colorado, New Mexico, & Texas) Rio Grande River compact agreement.
 This position will co-lead the development of a structured decision making (SDM) framework and a series of predictive modeling tools. For the SDM component, the postdoc will co-lead a series of annual workshops focused on expert elicitation of model parameters, and model validation. We are developing multiple simulation-based decision support tools such as: an environmental flow model linked to a Bayesian integrated population model for the minnow to predict the outcomes of water management decision at broad scales; and optimization analyses to select a combination of flow and non-flow management actions according to environmental conditions. 
 The postdoc will be supervised by Dr. Abby Lawson and Dr. Kasey Pregler of the USGS New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit based at New Mexico State University based at New Mexico State University in the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Ecology, and Dr. Charles Yackulic (USGS Southwest Biological Science Center), while working closely with partners from the Bureau of Reclamation and U.S Fish and Wildlife Service. More information on RGSM conservation efforts in the Middle Rio Grande can be found here. 
 Responsibilities:
Co-lead a series of standing calls and webinars with PIs and interested parties, handle administrative tasks.
Develop a series of predictive decision support models to determine optimal allocation of environmental flows under hydrologic conditions paired with, and optimization analyses to identify sets of management actions under uncertainty.
Co-lead collaborative workshops that will focus on eliciting model parameters, and beta-testing of decision support tools.
Lead the development of multiple manuscripts focused on the environmental flows modeling and other decision analytic tools (e.g., multi-criteria decision analysis, risk analysis, value of information).
 

Position structure:
This announcement is funded for up to two years through a Bureau of Reclamation grant contingent on satisfactory progress. The successful candidate will be hired through New Mexico State University (Las Cruces, NM) and be based on the main campus, though remote options may be considered. The preferred start period is as soon as possible, but a later start date may be considered.
 The postdoctoral researcher will be provided an annual salary ranging between $63,000 – $70,000 depending on experience, plus benefits, a desktop computer (based at NMSU) with high processing speeds, and travel funds to attend conferences and a training opportunity. This position is an excellent opportunity to engage with agency professionals and conduct cutting-edge quantitative research.
 Qualifications:
Minimum qualifications:
Ph.D. degree by start date in Wildlife, Fisheries, Ecology, or related field by the anticipated start date (preferred late fall 2025)
Expertise in R coding language.
Demonstrated desire and proven ability to publish in peer-reviewed journals.
Excellent written and personal communication skills
The ability to work both independently and collaboratively, and to meet deadlines.
 Desired qualifications:
Competitive candidates will have a background in one or more of the following areas*: modeling of environmental flows, stochastic simulations, Bayesian hierarchical modeling of population dynamics, constructing GUI-based decision support tools (e.g., R-shiny apps, Python, NetLogo, etc.), optimization analysis, or structured decision making.
 *Note: We do not expect a single candidate to possess all or most of these skills, as will join a team that includes other researchers and mentors with experience in these areas. These skills reflect ideal, but not required qualifications. We have some project funding for the postdoc to attend a training opportunity, so the selected applicant may learn these skills on the job.
 How to apply:
Submit an application through our online portal (link below). Applicants will be asked to provide the following: (1) a writing sample (such as a published manuscript or Ph.D. dissertation), (2) letter of interest that describes your qualifications and how this position fits into your career goals; (3) CV or resume that includes contact information (phone and email) for at least three references; (4) unofficial transcripts from your PhD institution.
 Applications will be reviewed as they are received, though the position will remain open until a suitable candidate is found. We anticipate beginning interviews in late September.

Description
WildComm Research Stations is a conservation organisation based in South Africa, dedicated to hands-on research and training for the next generation of conservationists. Located within a private reserve—home to two of the Big Five, rich birdlife, 380 tree species, and notable herpetofaunal diversity—we provide interns with meaningful opportunities to contribute to long-term ecological monitoring and conservation management.

About the Internship
Understanding the full scope of biodiversity is essential for effective conservation, especially in ecologically rich but under-documented regions like northern Limpopo. This internship focuses on documenting and assessing the presence, distribution, and diversity of reptiles and amphibians across the reserve.

Interns will:
Conduct active searches and walk transects to detect herpetofauna
Assist in monitoring using camera traps and opportunistic sightings
Record detailed field data on species identity, habitat, and behaviour
Contribute to mapping species distributions and identifying biodiversity hotspots
Support long-term monitoring of ecological changes across habitats

Who Should Apply?
This opportunity is ideal for students or graduates in ecology, zoology, herpetology, or related fields
No prior herpetology experience is required, though an interest in reptiles and amphibians is essential
Applicants should be comfortable working outdoors in varied weather conditions
A reasonable level of fitness is needed, as fieldwork is conducted entirely on foot

Duration
Flexible | We recommend a commitment of 2–4 months to gain meaningful field skills and contribute to long-term monitoring.

Conservation Fee
As you’ll be living on a wildlife reserve, part of your fee contributes directly to the protection of the land and the species it supports.

What’s Included
Accommodation on the reserve
Transport: Louis Trichardt pick-up/drop-off
Biweekly town trips for supplies

How to Apply
If you’re ready to explore the fascinating world of reptiles and amphibians while contributing to biodiversity conservation, send your CV and cover letter to applications@wildcomm.org

Description
Earthjustice seeks an associate attorney to join our Northeast Regional Office based in New York City. The Associate Attorney will support and collaborate with our team of lawyers and scientists working to support healthy communities and speed the transition from dirty fossil fuels to clean energy solutions in the Northeast region. The position requires 2-5 years of post-law school legal experience.

The Northeast Regional Office is dedicated to protecting public health and ensuring a healthy environment for all in the Northeast; combatting the climate crisis; and securing a swift and equitable transition to zero emissions, 100% clean energy. We focus on matters in the Northeast, and also take on mission-critical work outside of this region.

Earthjustice is the nation’s leading environmental law organization. Wielding the power of law, Earthjustice partners with our clients to take on the most critical fights of our time — fights to protect the incredible biodiversity and wild places of the planet; to avert climate disaster by transitioning society away from fossil fuels toward clean energy; to safeguard the right of all people to a healthy environment. We are here because the earth needs a good lawyer.

Founded in 1971, Earthjustice has a distinguished track record of achieving significant, lasting environmental protections. We achieve this by hiring people who share a passion for justice and a healthy environment. Our headquarters are in San Francisco with offices in Anchorage, Bozeman, Chicago, Denver, Honolulu, Houston, Juneau, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York, Seattle, Tallahassee and Washington, D.C.

The Associate Attorney position is a three-year position with the potential for extension, designed to help attorneys who are in the early stages of their careers to develop into thoughtful, professional, and effective advocates skilled in the various phases of public interest litigation. As Associate Attorneys gain experience, they gradually take on more independent responsibility for their cases but work throughout their tenure under the supervision of Senior Attorneys, Deputy Managing Attorneys, or the Managing Attorney. Many Associates have gone on to other positions within Earthjustice and with other public interest organizations.

This is a hybrid position based in our New York City office and requires regular in-person attendance.

Responsibilities

Associate attorneys perform a range of litigation and advocacy-related tasks that can include:

Conducting legal and factual research and preparing memoranda on issues related to ongoing or potential new cases.
Reviewing and analyzing administrative records and technical documents.
Drafting motions, briefs, and other legal and factual documents in support of litigation.
Participating in proceedings before federal and state courts and agencies.
Working with clients and experts and learning how to handle press work.
Hiring and supervising law students who work at Earthjustice as interns or clerks.
Qualifications

Law school graduate admitted to, or qualified and willing to apply for admission to, the New York State Bar.
2-5 years of post-law school legal experience.
Excellent research, analytic, writing and communication skills.
Strong work ethic and initiative, and sound yet creative judgment.
Strong desire to fight for the right of all to a healthy environment.
Ability to work constructively and in a highly professional manner in a diverse, dynamic, and hard-working team-oriented atmosphere.
Commitment to public interest work and a passion for the role of Earthjustice and its mission, including a desire to fight for the right of all to a healthy environment.
Emotional intelligence and sensitivity to the needs and concerns of individuals associated with diverse cultures, backgrounds and orientations.
Ability and willingness to travel as needed for case work, court appearances, and presentations.
We offer a mission- and employee-focused work environment and a competitive compensation package, including excellent benefits. Earthjustice is an equal opportunity employer and highly values diversity. As a 501(c)(3) organization, Earthjustice is a qualifying employer for purposes of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program.

Compensation is based on experience and location.

Salary range in New York, NY: $119,100 - $131,900

 Purpose — About Southeast Conservation Corps (SECC):
Empowering youth and adults to cultivate compassion, responsibility and life skills through community service, hard work and land stewardship.    
 SECC, a program of Conservation Legacy, is a non-profit AmeriCorps program. We engage youth (age 15-17) and young adults (ages 18-30, up to 35 for veterans) in service projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. Our AmeriCorps positions provide impactful educational and service opportunities that benefit both communities and landscapes. SECC’s participants reflect the population of the Southeast region, including youth, graduates, veterans, and individuals from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. 
SECC collaborates with land management agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, local municipalities, and non-profits to host day and camping crews. Our projects vary but include trail construction and maintenance, restoration of natural areas, invasive species removal, fire fuels reduction, fencing, herbicide applications, and more. Most projects involve strenuous manual labor and require hiking to and from the project sites daily, carrying tools and day packs.   
 SECC camping crews serve and camp overnight in front country and backcountry locations, often in challenging weather conditions. While hitch schedules vary by project and location, they typically follow a 9-day on, 5-day off pattern, with 10-hour shifts and scheduled breaks throughout the day. While we aim to maintain consistency, flexibility is expected as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change based on project needs.   
 SECC is an independent, non-residential program, and crew members are responsible for securing their own housing when not in the field. On-hitch, crews manage camp chores and prepare all their own meals, with evenings often including group discussions. Members must provide their own personal outdoor gear (e.g., tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, multi-day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots), while SECC provides group camp equipment, tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC Office and project sites. 
 Description of Duties  
 Service Project:  
SECC and the Cherokee National Forest have partnered to host a Stream Restoration Felling & Rigging Crew. The crew will be based out of SECC’s office in Chattanooga, TN and travel to complete conservation service projects along the Citico Creek Watershed and other streams in the Cherokee National Forest. The crew will be managed by the Cherokee National Forest and will support their fisheries biologists and hydrologists.  
 Crew members will collaborate as a team to assist in activities that support native fish and other important aquatic resources on the Cherokee National Forest, TN. The primary focus of the season will be habitat improvement through strategic wood placement on select streams utilizing grip hoist rigging techniques and chainsaws to selectively place trees into stream channels.  
 During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors in all weather conditions, performing heavy manual labor to complete conservation and restoration projects. Most projects require hiking through difficult terrain while carrying gear (up to 50lbs) to remote work sites for the day. We ask that crew members embrace learning opportunities, face challenges, and build community with their crew.  
 Project Duties:  
With appropriate training and under the guidance of a crew leader, use tools (chainsaws, grip hoist, hand tools, pulleys, levers) to place trees into streams to create woody habitat structures for aquatic species. Although orientations will be implemented, applicants with a strong background in chainsaw felling and rigging are encouraged to apply. 
Transport gear (up to 50lbs/crew member) daily across difficult terrain 
Collaborate as a team with a high degree of coordination and communication 
Keep a positive attitude and follow directions while conducting physically demanding projects, often in inclement weather.  
Maintain equipment and report maintenance/equipment needs to supervisor.  
Collaborate on field design and implementation of structures to enhance stream morphology.  
Operate in areas with no cellular service.  
Perform all duties with safety as top priority.  
Maintain a high level of integrity while in the field. 
 Note: While the staff at SECC and partners strive to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs. 
 Opportunities to Extend Your Service 
SECC’s winter crew members have the opportunity to focus on developing their technical and interpersonal skills throughout their season to prepare for taking on potential member or leadership roles with SECC during the remainder of the year. Please be prepared to discuss your interest in continuing your service through summer/fall. 
 Note: placement in member or leadership positions are not guaranteed and will be based on qualifications, performance, work ethic, and ability. We highly encourage those who participate to stay on throughout the summer.   
  Crew Life:    
SECC crews consist of 4-6 crew members and 2 crew leaders who provide project expertise, mentorship, training, and support to ensure the success of all participants. Food is provided while in the field, and crew members collaborate to plan meals and share chores, such as cooking and washing dishes. Most dietary restrictions can be accommodated if communicated in advance. Crew members must be prepared to camp, travel, complete service projects, and share meals as a team. No drug or alcohol consumption is allowed during service-related activities or travel at any time.   
 Crew members will need to supply their own personal equipment such as a day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots, etc. SECC will provide tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC office and project sites. SECC has a limited supply of loaner gear available for crew members to borrow. While this gear can be helpful, we strongly recommend that members bring as much of their own gear as possible, as the loaner equipment may not fully meet personal preferences or specific needs. 
 SECC supports a culture of feedback and growth. Crew Members will set goals at the beginning of the season and review their performance through both self-evaluation and a review with their Crew Leader in the middle and at the end of their season. Evaluations will cover areas such as professionalism, responsibility and leadership, communication, engagement, productivity, safety, and equipment use. Crew Members will also be asked to evaluate their Crew Leaders’ performance, the overall program, and their experience at the end of their term.  
     Hitch Schedule:     
This position will operate on a variable “hitch” schedule, but generally it will follow 9 days on and 5 days off for camping crews. Project days follow a 10-hour shift with scheduled time for breaks. While the staff at SECC strive to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs.  Applicants should be prepared to camp during hitches for the duration of the season, with lodging provided on a case-by-case basis if necessary.

 SECC collaborates with land management agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, local municipalities, and non-profits to host day and camping crews. Our projects vary but include trail construction and maintenance, restoration of natural areas, invasive species removal, fire fuels reduction, fencing, herbicide applications, and more. Most projects involve strenuous manual labor and require hiking to and from the project sites daily, carrying tools and day packs.   
 SECC camping crews serve in frontcountry and backcountry locations, often in challenging weather conditions. While hitch schedules vary by project and location, they typically follow a 9-day on, 5-day off pattern, with 10-hour shifts and scheduled breaks throughout the day. While we aim to maintain consistency, flexibility is expected as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change based on project needs.   
 SECC is an independent, non-residential program, and crew members are responsible for securing their own housing when not in the field. On-hitch, crews manage camp chores and prepare all their own meals, with evenings often including group discussions. Members must provide their own personal outdoor gear (e.g., tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, multi-day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots), while SECC provides group camp equipment, tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC Office and project sites. 
    Description of Duties 
The crew member position is an entry-level role. During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors in all weather conditions, performing heavy manual labor to complete conservation and restoration projects. Most projects require hiking out to remote work sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack. While prior experience with the outdoors or outdoor work can be helpful, it is not a necessity for this position. We ask that crew members embrace learning opportunities, face challenges, and build community with their crew.  
    Service Project:   
    The crew will be based out of SECC’s office in Chattanooga, TN and travel to complete various conservation projects across the Southeast Region, partnering with land managers such as the US Forest Service, the National Park Service, Tennessee State Parks, and other land partners. The crew will be managed by land managers who will collaborate with crews to complete conservation projects.  
 Service projects vary depending on seasonal factors and safety considerations. While the staff at SECC and partners strive to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs. However, tasks may also include, but are not limited to:   
Trail construction and maintenance 
Corridor cleaning 
Invasive species removal 
Habitat restoration 
Fence installation and repair 
Bridge installation and repair 
Community Service 
 Opportunities to Extend Your Service 
SECC’s winter crew members have the opportunity to focus on developing their technical and interpersonal skills throughout their season to prepare for taking on potential member or leadership roles with SECC during the remainder of the year. Please be prepared to discuss your interest in continuing your service through summer/fall.

Most dietary restrictions can be accommodated if communicated in advance. Crew members must be prepared to camp, travel, complete service projects, and share meals as a team. No drug or alcohol consumption is allowed during service-related activities or travel at any time.   
 Crew members will need to supply their own personal equipment such as a day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots, etc. SECC will provide tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC office and project sites. SECC has a limited supply of loaner gear available for crew members to borrow. While this gear can be helpful, we strongly recommend that members bring as much of their own gear as possible, as the loaner equipment may not fully meet personal preferences or specific needs. 
 SECC supports a culture of feedback and growth. Crew Members will set goals at the beginning of the season and review their performance through both self-evaluation and a review with their Crew Leader in the middle and at the end of their season. Evaluations will cover areas such as professionalism, responsibility and leadership, communication, engagement, productivity, safety, and equipment use. Crew Members will also be asked to evaluate their Crew Leaders’ performance, the overall program, and their experience at the end of their term.  
     Hitch Schedule:     
This position will operate on a variable “hitch” schedule, but generally it will follow 9 days on and 5 days off for camping crews. Project days follow a 10-hour shift with scheduled time for breaks. While the staff at SECC strive to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs.  Applicants should be prepared to camp during hitches for the duration of the season, with lodging provided on a case-by-case basis if necessary.

The crew will be managed by LBL Forest Service staff to complete their conservation projects.  
 Service projects will vary depending on seasonal factors and safety considerations. Weather can especially have a significant impact on fire operations. When it comes to prescribed fire operations, the project is dependent on the weather.

This means that all Agency employees may be asked or assigned to participate in rotating temporary duty assignments to support emergency programs at some time during their careers with APHIS. It is difficult to predict the frequency with which such emergency situations may occur – and could range from several emergencies in a year to none over the course of many years.

In addition, it may be necessary for employees to participate in multiple rotations to an emergency program assignment. Attempts will be made to keep disruption to the employee to a minimum.
