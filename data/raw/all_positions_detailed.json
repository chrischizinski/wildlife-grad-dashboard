Persistence of alpine avifauna will depend upon the ability of individuals to seek out microhabitats that provide cool refugia while engaging in behaviors that reduce energy expenditure. Identifying such microclimate refugia and understanding how alpine birds use them will help inform management strategies for conserving alpine ecosystems in the face of rapid temperature warming. This funded PhD project focuses on two focal species, Rock Ptarmigan and Rock Partridge, using state-of-the-art GPS tracking technology to quantify fine-scale movement patterns, as well as climate monitoring at study sites and land surface temperature mapping using a thermal drone. The project is located in the Swiss Alps and has completed two field seasons, with fieldwork projected to continue for an additional 1-2 years. \n\nThe successful PhD Candidate will have access to the full study data set, with the opportunity to develop new field and/or analytical components depending upon logistics, expertise and interest. The Candidate must hold a MSc degree in biology or equivalent and ideally will show a strong interest in conservation science, environmental management and spatial analyses. \n\nAdditional preferred (but not required) skills include: field experience studying birds or other vertebrates in montane landscapes, strong quantitative background with ability and interest to rapidly gain new skillsets related to the joint analysis of animal movement, climate, and remote sensing data, and knowledge of French and/or German. \n\nThe project will be co-advised as a collaboration between Prof. Dr. Raphaël Arlettaz at University of Bern Division of Conservation Biology (Switzerland) and Assistant Professor Dr. Ian Ausprey at Texas A&M University Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology (USA).

The position is part volunteer, but stipends are available to cover expenses and to reward accomplishments after proven results over a trial period. The GC Bear Conservation Specialist will rapidly gain valuable professional experience and connections by playing an exciting, integral role on the WRF team. Work to build WRF’s bear conservation capacity and impact on Yellowstone area bears as you contribute and strengthen your conservation knowledge and skills. Gain recognition for your efforts among area partners, on the WRF website and elsewhere, as you participate visibly in meeting WRF’s mission, which is to increase park wildlife population viability both ex situ and in situ, working closely with National Parks and Forests, state wildlife and tourism agencies, Tribes, zoo partners, and park gateway communities. \n WRF operates effectively and efficiently and generates resources that enable measurable, boots-on-the-ground conservation results. The WRF Bear Conservation Specialist for Glacier Country Northwest (GC) will focus on implementation of the “I Am Bear Safe” Project in Bigfork, Columbia Falls, Coram, Hungry Horse, Kalispell, Lakeside, Somers and West Glacier and possibly other towns that are Glacier’s gateway communities. The GC Bear Conservation Specialist will collaborate with the WRF President, Beary Program Director/GC Project Coordinator, and other team members, as well as partnering chambers of commerce and Glacier National Park and possibly Tribes in connection to the “I Am Bear Safe” Project. [https://www.wildlifeandparks.org/projects]. \n “I Am Bear Safe”™ (IABS) is a multi-partner WRF Collaborating with Wildlife Strategy designed to equip National Park gateway community chambers of commerce and their member businesses (“Park Gateway Partners”), as well as Tribes, to “train people not to train bears” to get in the trouble they are in now because of human behavior—a situation that is assuring bear demise. Bears are a top attraction at many National Parks and are well-managed within the parks to avoid human interaction. But communities at the park’s edge are not often sufficiently prepared or equipped for the increasing pressure of more visitors coupled with rapid development, naïve new residents, and a growing number of recreationists in bear country. Park Gateway Partner (PGP) businesses are the perfect intervention point and receive marketing benefits from participating in the IABS town-based bear stewardship effort. WRF provides customized tools (signage and SWAG) that equip PGPs to effectively intercept park visitors and recreationists and equip them to be bear stewards who act responsibly by securing attractants and following park and Tribal rules for recreating in bear habitat. The IABS goal is that bears perform their natural behaviors and survive without risk and distraction caused by humans while supporting the economic benefits to park gateway towns from responsible tourism and recreation. \n Responsibilities: \n·         Track the inventory of IABS Toolkit (signage) items needed by and distributed to PGPs in each town. \n·         Distribute IABS Toolkt materials to PGPs and redistribution points. \n·         Recruit new PGPs, as appropriate and assigned. \n·         Field questions and relay PGP concerns to WRF. \n·         Attend meetings of the chamber of commerce or local partner organization and events on occasion. \n·         Help keep IABS Management Database up-to-date for GC towns \n·         Use creative ways to stimulate Bear Quiz-takers. \n·         Come up with novel ideas to make the IABS Project more effective. \n Education & Experience \nBachelor’s degree in relevant subject is required; graduate degree helpful.\nKnowledge and experience specific to grizzly and black bears preferred.\nExperience working with community-based organizations and/or local businesses required. \nOutgoing nature and proven to be self-motivated.\n\n \n\nWRF Bear Conservation Specialists are asked to participate in an initial (virtual) training then designate 16 hours a week to WRF and agree to work with WRF for 4 months. The GC Bear Conservation Specialist must be a self-starter, ambitious, creative, productive, and dedicated to WRF’s mission. S/he must also exhibit a high degree of professionalism, accountability, and ability to follow instructions and manage time well. S/he should be friendly and approachable, well-spoken, bold, and personable.  The position is initially unpaid, but stipends can be provided for approved expenses and as results are achieved. \n\nThe Bear Conservation Specialist will report to the WRF President. Hours are flexible within the week, with the exception that PGP recruitment, Tools deliveries and communications best occur during Monday-Friday business hours. Participation in biweekly IABS team meetings and occasional full WRF team meetings by Zoom are required.\n\n \n\nTo apply: Please send a short (less than one page) cover letter and resume (maximum 2 pages) with references to info@wildlifeandparks.org. Please name the (single, if possible) electronic file as follows: [Date]_BearCS-GC_[Your Name]. \n\n \n\nThank you for your dedication to bears and excitement about being part of the Wildlife Restoration Foundation team in Glacier Country!\n  Contact\nJA Randall\ninfo@wildlifeandparks.org (preferred contact method)",

This means that all Agency employees may be asked or assigned to participate in rotating temporary duty assignments to support emergency programs at some time during their careers with APHIS.  It is difficult to predict the frequency with which such emergency situations may occur – and could range from several emergencies in a year to none over the course of many years.  In the event that you are called upon to support an emergency program, this may require irregular working hours, including overtime, and may include duties other than those specified in your official position description.

In addition, it may be necessary for employees to participate in multiple rotations to an emergency program assignment.  Attempts will be made to keep disruption to the employee to a minimum.\n See this link: https://www.usajobs.gov//Help/working-in-government/fair-and-transparent/signature-false-statements/\n NOTE: APPLICANTS FOR THIS POSITION WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO URINALYSIS TO SCREEN FOR ILLEGAL DRUG USE PRIOR TO APPOINTMENT.
