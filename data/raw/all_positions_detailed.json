Persistence of alpine avifauna will depend upon the ability of individuals to seek out microhabitats that provide cool refugia while engaging in behaviors that reduce energy expenditure. Identifying such microclimate refugia and understanding how alpine birds use them will help inform management strategies for conserving alpine ecosystems in the face of rapid temperature warming. This funded PhD project focuses on two focal species, Rock Ptarmigan and Rock Partridge, using state-of-the-art GPS tracking technology to quantify fine-scale movement patterns, as well as climate monitoring at study sites and land surface temperature mapping using a thermal drone. The project is located in the Swiss Alps and has completed two field seasons, with fieldwork projected to continue for an additional 1-2 years. \n\nThe successful PhD Candidate will have access to the full study data set, with the opportunity to develop new field and/or analytical components depending upon logistics, expertise and interest. The Candidate must hold a MSc degree in biology or equivalent and ideally will show a strong interest in conservation science, environmental management and spatial analyses. \n\nAdditional preferred (but not required) skills include: field experience studying birds or other vertebrates in montane landscapes, strong quantitative background with ability and interest to rapidly gain new skillsets related to the joint analysis of animal movement, climate, and remote sensing data, and knowledge of French and/or German. \n\nThe project will be co-advised as a collaboration between Prof. Dr. Raphaël Arlettaz at University of Bern Division of Conservation Biology (Switzerland) and Assistant Professor Dr. Ian Ausprey at Texas A&M University Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology (USA).

The project utilizes sites that are part of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)—one of the largest grassland restoration initiatives in the U.S.  For example in Kansas, the CRP program has re-established approximately 1 million acres of native grassland; however, most of these sites do not include a dominant grazer despite the critical role that bison historically played in these systems.  Our project tests whether strategic cattle-grazing can enhance the conservation benefits to native plant communities and bird habitat in short and tallgrass prairie regions (Colorado and Kansas).  Two specific project objectives for this graduate position are to 1) quantify how grazers influence plant structural heterogeneity in ways that may improve habitat for wildlife and 2) examine how grazers influence the re-establishment of native plants.  \n This M.S. position requires someone who is self-motivated, works well with a team of field researchers, and has a strong interest in ecology.  The project will involve extensive fieldwork in Kansas and Colorado particularly during the summers.  Some knowledge of grassland plants is preferred, but strong students with the aptitude to learn plants quickly will also be considered.  Because we will be collaborating with private landowners, experience working in the United States is required as well as proficiency in spoken and written English.

    "requirements": "Graduate Assistantship (M.S.), Grassland Plant Ecology \n I am seeking a highly motivated individual to join a collaborative team studying the role of a dominant grazer in replanted, native grasslands.  The project utilizes sites that are part of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)—one of the largest grassland restoration initiatives in the U.S.  For example in Kansas, the CRP program has re-established approximately 1 million acres of native grassland; however, most of these sites do not include a dominant grazer despite the critical role that bison historically played in these systems.  Our project tests whether strategic cattle-grazing can enhance the conservation benefits to native plant communities and bird habitat in short and tallgrass prairie regions (Colorado and Kansas).  Two specific project objectives for this graduate position are to 1) quantify how grazers influence plant structural heterogeneity in ways that may improve habitat for wildlife and 2) examine how grazers influence the re-establishment of native plants.  \n This M.S. position requires someone who is self-motivated, works well with a team of field researchers, and has a strong interest in ecology.  The project will involve extensive fieldwork in Kansas and Colorado particularly during the summers.  Some knowledge of grassland plants is preferred, but strong students with the aptitude to learn plants quickly will also be considered.  Because we will be collaborating with private landowners, experience working in the United States is required as well as proficiency in spoken and written English.

Grand Rapids is a small, rural community in north-central Minnesota. The Forestry Sciences Laboratory is located on the University of Minnesota North Central Research and Outreach Center adjacent to the Minnesota North Community College - Itasca Campus. \n\nAt the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: The chemistry laboratory in the Grand Rapids Forestry Sciences Laboratory supports studies of forest and resource management. The office is part of the Research and Development program of the Northern Research Station (NRS) of the USDA Forest Service. The primary opportunity of the fellows will be to participate in the preparation of samples for chemical analysis and learn a range of skills associated with a chemistry laboratory. Samples may be soils, sediments, plant tissues, or water collected from studies. In addition to research of NRS scientists, the laboratory supports analysis for the NRS Forest Inventory and Analysis Program, the Air Resource Monitoring Program, other cooperating federal agencies, and academic partners. The opportunity will include cataloging and organization of incoming samples, processing and preparing samples for analysis and entering of data produced during analysis. Fellows will collaborate with the laboratory manager (chemist), a physical sciences technician, and other staff associated with mentoring by a hydrologist/project leader (supervisor of all staff within the local research unit).\n\nLearning Objectives: Fellows arriving with more advanced skills and experience with chemical analysis may be provided the opportunity to learn about instrument calibration, operation, and data quality control/quality assurance procedures, or operate analytical instruments for the measurement for basic inorganic solutes/constituents and nutrients.
