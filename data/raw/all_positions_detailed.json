Coyotes have relatively recently colonized the southeast, taking on the role of the largest carnivore across much of the region and exerting top-down effects on the native large herbivore (white-tailed deer) and other trophic levels. At the same time, wild pigs have spread across much of the southeast, and our recent research suggests they are impacting predator-prey dynamics in this system. However, disentangling the relative effects of coyotes and wild pigs individually on ecosystem processes has heretofore been limited due to the fact that both species occur ubiquitously across any area where they co-occur, i.e., studying the effects of one species in isolation from the other has been impossible. Therefore, with state and federal partners, we will be using large (100 acre) exclosures that will selectively exclude each of these target species. \n\nThe student is expected to take part in this exciting new project (exclosures were just constructed) by developing research questions related specifically to deer and other mammalian responses to our experimental design. Within the study area we are placing GPS tracking collars on coyotes, deer and wild pigs, allowing the student to investigate questions regarding how removal of predation risk and/or risk of interacting with the dominant competitor (i.e., wild pigs) impact deer movement behavior, stress physiology, maternal care and fawn survival.

Specifically, our project will explore how farm noise affects the behavior of barn owls and their rodent prey in vineyards. We will experimentally play tractor noise and track its effects on rodent boldness/abundance as well as on owl hunting in vineyards. We will also test an ‘audio lure’ that farmers may use to concentrate owl hunting in problem areas. This project is a collaboration between UC Davis (Karen Gallardo Cruz, Prof. Daniel Karp, Prof. Gail Patricelli), Cal Poly Humboldt (Prof. Matthew Johnson), and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (Prof. Clinton Francis). \n\nThe field technician will work collaboratively to monitor barn owl nest boxes, quantify nestling growth, use GPS devices to track the movement of parent birds, monitor rodent boldness/abundance with camera traps and non-toxic bait stations, and conduct night-time surveys of owls with night-vision binoculars. Additionally, the field technician will assist in capture of parent birds to collect morphometric measurements, as well as fit/remove GPS tags via backpack harnesses. Other duties will include entering data, setting up/taking down heavy electronic equipment for noise experiments and nest box cameras, climbing tall orchard ladders to work with owl nest boxes, and other related tasks. Much of the fieldwork will occur at night-time, though there will also be daytime work. All fieldwork will occur in vineyards surrounding Lodi, CA.

    "requirements": "Job Title: Avian agroecology technician  \n\nDescription:\nWe are seeking 1-2 seasonal field technicians from mid-March through June 2026, with possible extension of work until July, to assist PhD student Karen Gallardo Cruz within the Karp Lab at UC Davis on a study examining the effects of tractor noise on barn owls in vineyards. Specifically, our project will explore how farm noise affects the behavior of barn owls and their rodent prey in vineyards. We will experimentally play tractor noise and track its effects on rodent boldness/abundance as well as on owl hunting in vineyards. We will also test an ‘audio lure’ that farmers may use to concentrate owl hunting in problem areas. This project is a collaboration between UC Davis (Karen Gallardo Cruz, Prof. Daniel Karp, Prof. Gail Patricelli), Cal Poly Humboldt (Prof. Matthew Johnson), and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (Prof. Clinton Francis). \n\nThe field technician will work collaboratively to monitor barn owl nest boxes, quantify nestling growth, use GPS devices to track the movement of parent birds, monitor rodent boldness/abundance with camera traps and non-toxic bait stations, and conduct night-time surveys of owls with night-vision binoculars. Additionally, the field technician will assist in capture of parent birds to collect morphometric measurements, as well as fit/remove GPS tags via backpack harnesses. Other duties will include entering data, setting up/taking down heavy electronic equipment for noise experiments and nest box cameras, climbing tall orchard ladders to work with owl nest boxes, and other related tasks. Much of the fieldwork will occur at night-time, though there will also be daytime work. All fieldwork will occur in vineyards surrounding Lodi, CA. Field training will be provided to help the technician become familiar with established protocols and methodologies, but prior raptor-handling experience is a plus.
