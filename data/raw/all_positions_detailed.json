The lab spans the full spectrum of zooplankton groups from crustaceans to gelatinous taxa, from morphological to molecular identifications, and from net-based sampling to in situ imaging. The position will involve several weeks per year in the field (typically on larger research vessels), operation and maintenance of field-going electronic equipment, plus processing of samples in the laboratory and conducting preliminary analysis of the data generated. The opportunity also exists for varying degrees of involvement in scientific publication. Prior experience working with zooplankton is required, as is computer proficiency. Prior experience is desirable but not required for molecular laboratory work or imaging systems, as essential training on either can be provided.\n\nCFOS is one of the most geographically diverse units at UAF. The College is headquartered in Fairbanks with additional locations in Anchorage and our coastal facilities include the Seward Marine Center, the NOAA-UAF Kasitsna Bay Laboratory, and the Juneau Lena Point Fisheries Facility. The College has over 150 faculty, researchers and staff based throughout Alaska. \n\nThis is anticipated to be a long-term hire as part of larger team of zooplankton professionals and graduate students. This position is located on the Troth Yeddha' campus in Fairbanks Alaska. The position has some flexibility in work schedule and the number of hours worked per week, such that the successful candidate may elect to work less than full time if desired (i.e., from 20-40 hours per week).\n\nThis is a term-funded, exempt staff position complete with both a competitive salary and full employee benefits package. UA provides a generous compensation package that includes retirement options, annual leave, 12 paid holidays per year, tuition waivers for employees and family members, and affordable medical, dental and vision care coverage. New hires will be placed on the UA Staff Salary Schedule, Grade 79, based on education and experience.\n\nApplications will be accepted for review on February 19, 2026, to ensure consideration, please apply by 11:55 PM, Alaska Standard Time on February 18, 2026.

Its primary purpose is to serve the original needs of the NGO’s operations which are wildlife conservation through research and education. This is accomplished through the layout of the farm which provides extensive wildlife habitat and foraging opportunities, increasing the local faunal biodiversity as well as acting as an educational demonstration to local subsistence farmers and visiting students.  \n  Interns will learn by assisting in implementation and evaluation of management practices, cropping, and record keeping on the farm with this vision in mind while we endeavor to maximize the products coming from the farm with the existing design and layout using sustainable and regenerative practices specific to the Mesoamerican uplands. Within this broad framework, intern projects can include several basic Agricultural Education disciplines including Tropical Agriculture, Sustainable/organic Agriculture, Farm Management, Waste management, and Agricultural Economics.  \n  In addition to planting crops, we also have free range chickens and ducks for eggs and meat. We are looking to increase our revenue generation from the farm either in the form of increased accountable products entering our kitchen for use in our restaurant, or for sale to the Mobile Market or in a proposed road-side café which would be managed by T.R.E.E.S kitchen and hospitality staff. Thus, interns would also assist us with our marketing strategy for existing products and/or planting. \n  By the successful conclusion of this internship, the student will be able to apply practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species, basic free range poultry operations, evaluate different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns, and become familiar with sustainable management practices such as no/low till, cover cropping, waste management, mulching, marketing, Farm-to-Table, etc. \n    Requirements: \n No prior tropical agriculture experience required. Interns can be current undergraduate or graduate students enrolled in a program with their University/College for credit, however non-students can also apply; but preference will be given to students enrolled in an accreditation program. Experienced tropical agriculturalists and/or agroforestry professionals are also welcome and will be treated according to their experience level and are eligible for *discounted rates. \n    Internship Responsibilities: \n Applying practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species and basic free range poultry operations. \nEvaluating different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns. \nWork on Inga Alley-cropping and other regenerative cropping practices, and using intercropping, organic fertilizing and pest control practices. \nAssist with innovative marketing strategies for existing products accompanied by reviewing projected budgets for the farm and their products and exploring cost/profit ratios for poultry husbandry. \nPlanting and selling new products for the farm. \nOpportunities are also available to observe and participate with concurrent intern and wildlife educational activities such as mist-netting, observing and recording measurements of bats, birds, herps, invertebrates, water quality, and much more. \nInterns will assist with creating captions for social media posts to engage and update followers on what has been going on at the field station and various projects that are being done. \n     Costs: \n The internship fee includes room and board (meals included Monday-Friday), full access to lab equipment, and training by professional on-site biologists. Food is a combination of self-catering in a communal kitchen with ingredients provided as well as prepared meals, depending on whether we have other groups on site. Lodging at the research center signifies a shared dormitory-style rustic cabins with other same sex interns. This comes with full access to other facilities such as showers, restrooms, and kitchen. The nature of this program allows interns to carry out most of the work independently after the training period is done. Fees do not include airport transfer, flights, travel medical insurance, or $100 USD visitor permit fee if remaining in country for more than 30 days.    \n  We are hoping to expand our internship program beyond North America. Citizens from Latin America and the Caribbean will be charged at a discounted rate of 50%. Belizeans will get another discount. For more information, kindly email Scandia Cruz with the email provided above. \n    Schedule: \n Interns are required to work for 35 hours/week minimum. The typical schedule runs from Monday through Friday, from 6:30 am until 12:30 pm and 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm. Weekends are free time for interns; therefore, you can do as please (travel, hike, relax). No refunds on food and lodging will be available if the intern decides to leave the station. Projects may sometimes run into the weekend; in which case the days will be returned to them during the week. The intern supervisor(s) will be responsible for designing a schedule with the intern each week that is reasonable and includes work on the various projects. \n  Application:  \n For more information on our organization and facilities please visit our website: www.treesociety.org.
