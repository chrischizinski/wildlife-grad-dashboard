This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: This project will evaluate smoke emissions over a broad range of fuel, fuel moisture, and meteorological conditions and prescribed, cultural, and wildfire burn events. Using available software platforms, smoke emission factors and total smoke production by factor will be accounted for and differenced for the range of burn conditions as above. This research will involve a collaborative process with Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forests and create geospatial tools for wildfire, prescribed burning, and cultural burning related smoke trade-off analyses and quantitative forest landscape restoration and decision support. Results and findings will be submitted to one or more leading peer-reviewed journals, and presentations will be provided to Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest and other partners, along with the databases we create. The geospatial smoke tradeoffs dataset can then be used in project planning.\n\nLearning Objectives: The fellow will develop professionally while engaging in research-operational partnerships and learning about systems involving forest fuels and fire emissions modeling. They will gain experience with modeling, coding, and database management in support of a complex, multi-model ecological forecasting workflow. The fellow will gain valuable experience in advanced model development, calibration, and synthesis of the forest succession, fire severity, and climate change components of this workflow. The fellow will collaborate at the USDA Forest Service, Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest and will have the opportunity to improve professional collaboration and communication skills.\n\nMentor: The mentors for this opportunity are Brion Salter (robert.salter@usda.gov) and Dr. Paul Hessburg (paul.hessburg@usda.gov).

We seek to hire one or more postdoctoral scholars who conduct innovative biological research at the interface of applied and basic science. Our long-term goal is to help fund a cadre of innovative young scientists who will work closely with UCLA faculty, help broaden the mission of conservation science for the campus, and lead to long-term collaborations between our academic scientists and applied conservation practitioners that will direct and lead California conservation efforts.\n\nCandidates may work in any discipline that provides the scientific underpinnings for the preservation, protection, management, or restoration of at-risk species, environments, or ecological communities in California. Current and past La Kretz Postdocs have worked on a wide variety of research topics, ranging from urban biodiversity and evolutionary adaptation, to wildfire management and conservation, to the interface of conservation and animal behavior; we are open to work in any California ecosystem or group of organisms, as long as the research is innovative, creative, and has clear practical significance. An important initiative, the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP), is a large, multi-campus initiative led by the La Kretz Center that is delivering genomic resources to California decision-makers to enhance species and habitat management, and candidates may seek to build off of that project in the realm of conservation genomics. For a full description of past fellows and their work, please visit us at https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/lakretz/\n\nFellows must have both an on-campus UCLA mentor, and an off-campus, non-university mentor.

The opportunity is located in Kodiak, Alaska.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) formed the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) in 1999 as the focal point for NOAA’s coastal ocean science efforts. NCCOS uses cutting-edge research and high-tech instrumentation to provide citizens, coastal managers, public health officials, and other decision makers with reliable information needed to determine how best to protect environmental resources and public health, preserve valued habitats, and improve the way communities interact with coastal ecosystems. The NCCOS is headquartered in Silver Spring, MD but also has research labs across the nation. The NCCOS also has many assets including research programs, vessels, satellites, science centers, laboratories, and a vast pool of distinguished scientists and experts.\n\nThe HAB-F Branch delivers near real-time forecasting products for predicting the intensity/severity, location, and the potential health risk HABs pose in the Great Lakes and coastal regions of the U.S. While national in scope, forecasting efforts and products address regional needs and specific HAB species. The product sets are intended to support coastal resource managers, public health officials, researchers, and the public.\n\nResearch Project: Under the guidance of a technical mentor, the selected participant will gain experience in various research activities including performing and otherwise supporting collection of field data, including use of oceanographic monitoring instruments, collection of water, sediment and/or tissue samples and other activities. As well as conducting laboratory studies including toxin analysis, microscopy, molecular methods development and validation, and data analytics. This opportunity will also include engagement with, and training of, stakeholders in Alaska as well as generating outreach materials and technical documentation.\n\nThe specific project includes supporting ongoing research efforts in Alaska in support of HAB forecast development. Alaska experiences annual blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella, as well as other HAB species that can cause shellfish toxicity and vector toxins through the marine food web. There is a need for better monitoring and HAB forecasting products to help mitigate these blooms but much of Alaska is lacking in environmental monitoring data to support a HAB forecasting effort. The overarching goal of this project is to learn about data collection for HAB monitoring, and to help support forecasting data collection to mitigate the impacts of such blooms. This will involve collaborating with a variety of NOAA partners and interacting with stakeholders to support data collection from water, plankton and other biota, collection of environmental data with oceanographic sensors, and supporting laboratory processing of samples for analysis. \n\nLearning Objectives: The fellow will:\n\nDevelop an understanding of Alexandrium blooms, the cause of paralytic shellfish poisoning in Alaska.\nGain familiarity in keeping field data records and collection of data with oceanographic instruments.\nGain familiarity with collection of seawater, plankton, fish and invertebrates for microscopy and toxin analysis.\nGain familiarity with processing samples of seawater, plankton, sediment and biota for analysis.\nGain experience collaborating with diverse sets of partners and stakeholders.\nLearn about HAB-F capabilities in monitoring and modeling, including exposure to hydrographic and other field data, and maintaining laboratory and field records.\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Steven Kibler (steve.kibler@noaa.gov), with co-mentor Julie Matweyou (jamatweyou@alaska.edu). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: April 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be until September 30, 2025, but may be renewed upon recommendation of NOAA and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full-time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range for full-time participation is $5,100 per month, which includes a $300 per month health insurance allowance. The selected participant will also be awarded a travel allowance to attend training and/or to participate in a scientific meeting. \n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR).\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and NOAA.

Persistence of alpine avifauna will depend upon the ability of individuals to seek out microhabitats that provide cool refugia while engaging in behaviors that reduce energy expenditure. Identifying such microclimate refugia and understanding how alpine birds use them will help inform management strategies for conserving alpine ecosystems in the face of rapid temperature warming. This funded PhD project focuses on two focal species, Rock Ptarmigan and Rock Partridge, using state-of-the-art GPS tracking technology to quantify fine-scale movement patterns, as well as climate monitoring at study sites and land surface temperature mapping using a thermal drone. The project is located in the Swiss Alps and has completed two field seasons, with fieldwork projected to continue for an additional 1-2 years. \n\nThe successful PhD Candidate will have access to the full study data set, with the opportunity to develop new field and/or analytical components depending upon logistics, expertise and interest. The Candidate must hold a MSc degree in biology or equivalent and ideally will show a strong interest in conservation science, environmental management and spatial analyses. \n\nAdditional preferred (but not required) skills include: field experience studying birds or other vertebrates in montane landscapes, strong quantitative background with ability and interest to rapidly gain new skillsets related to the joint analysis of animal movement, climate, and remote sensing data, and knowledge of French and/or German. \n\nThe project will be co-advised as a collaboration between Prof. Dr. Raphaël Arlettaz at University of Bern Division of Conservation Biology (Switzerland) and Assistant Professor Dr. Ian Ausprey at Texas A&M University Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology (USA). The Candidate will spend the first year at Uni Bern and the second two years at Texas A&M University and must be willing and able to commit to this schedule (exact timing negotiable). The PhD will be defended and granted at Uni Bern. \n\nStart: January 2026. Duration: 3 years, with possible prolongation. Salary according to SNSF rules. \n\nApplications must be submitted to ian.ausprey@ag.tamu.edu and should include a motivation letter describing your interests, experience and relevance for this position, a CV (including a list of publications if available), abstract of MSc thesis, and contact information for three professional references (institution, email, and phone number).\n\nThe application deadline is September 7th, 2025, with online interviews during the second half of September 2025.\n\nContact\nDr. Ian Ausprey\nian.ausprey@ag.tamu.edu (preferred contact method)",

These positions will be advised by Dr. Dylan Maag in the Department of Life, Earth, and Environmental Sciences at WTAMU. This project will be a highly collaborative effort requiring both graduate assistants to work simultaneously and with summer field technicians on all aspects of field data collection. Students will then focus separately on the analysis of spatial ecology and hunting behavior/diet, while working together on habitat selection for their theses, manuscripts, and project reports.\n S. tergeminus is currently a Species of Greatest Conservation Need in Texas and is native to Texas grasslands (one of the most endangered habitats in TX). This project is funded by the Texas Office of the Comptroller through their Endangered Species Management Research. Students will use a combination of mark-recapture, radiotelemetry, animal-borne accelerometry, field videography, habitat sampling, and diet analysis in the field starting in late spring 2026 to early fall 2028 to achieve the following objectives: 1) Obtain basic demographic statistics for the population of S. tergeminus. 2) Estimate the spatial ecology of adult S. tergeminus. 3) Quantify diel and seasonal activity, and species-typical behaviors of adult snakes. 4) Model S. tergeminus habitat selection at multiple scales. 5) Measure critical spatial, temporal, selection, and social variables associated with overwintering. 6) Estimate and measure the snakes’ diets and hunting behaviors.\n Prospective students should be comfortable working alone and in teams in the field and will be expected to mentor research technicians and undergraduate volunteers throughout the project. Students should also be comfortable with being trained to safety handle venomous snakes with the goal of them handling the snakes themselves. Students should also expect to regularly interact with both TX state biologists and managers, and private landowners throughout the project.\n Qualifications: B.S. in Biology, Wildlife Biology, Zoology, or a related field is required. Students must meet the qualifications of WTAMU’s graduate program for MS, Biology, https://www.wtamu.edu/academics/college-agriculture-natural-sciences/department-life-earth-environmental-sciences/programs/graduate/biology-graduate-program.html (3.0 GPA in all undergraduate related science courses, etc.). Students must also possess a valid Driver’s License. Experience handling venomous snakes is NOT required but is preferred. Students must be willing to be trained to safely handle venomous snakes and demonstrate proficiency in doing so. Experience working within the R coding language, GIS programs, and radiotelemetry are preferred but not required. Lastly, this project is set to last for 38 months thus, students must be prepared to devote 2.5–3 years towards this project and their MS degree at WTAMU.\n Compensation: These are fully funded graduate research assistant positions (i.e., no teaching) that comes with a stipend of $26,159–27,794 per year for 6 consecutive semesters, starting in Spring 2026. WTAMU graduate assistants also qualify for a partial tuition waiver and medical insurance coverage.

Kennedy Waterfowl and Wetlands Conservation Center at Clemson University is seeking a highly motivated Ph.D. or M.S. candidate to conduct research on materials for tidal trunks and other water control structures with the goal of developing alternative, cost-effective solutions for water level management in waterfowl impoundments in coastal South Carolina. \n Water control structures are critical for effective wetland management. Historically, wooden tidal trunks had a life span of 25–30 years, but the discontinuation of chromate copper arsenate and creosote-treated lumber has reduced this to 8–10 years due to the use of pressure-treated lumber with alkaline copper quaternary preservatives. These trunks lose tensile strength from cyclic wetting and drying, salt crystal formation, decomposition, and insect colonization, with replacement costs reaching $20,000 to $25,000 each. Research is required to evaluate new materials and designs for tidal trunks while considering traditional design significance. The objectives of this study are to 1) inventory the number and characteristics of tidal trunks and other water control structures in South Carolina's coastal counties, 2) interview land managers and owners to evaluate critical and desirable design features of tidal trunks, 3) conduct a comprehensive literature review evaluating potential materials and designs, 4) document wildlife and invertebrate use of tidal trunks, 5) evaluate material performance, and 6) work with experienced tidal trunk builders to design, build, and install new prototypes.  \n The student will be working toward a graduate degree in Forest Resources, Biosystems Engineering, Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, or Civil Engineering at Clemson University. Clemson University (http://www.clemson.edu/about/) is a public land-grant Carnegie R1 Research University in a college town atmosphere on Lake Hartwell within view of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Students will take classes on the main campus and conduct fieldwork along South Carolina's coast at the Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center, the Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology and Forest Science, located on the 16,000-acre Hobcaw Barony property, and other coastal locations. \n The student will be advised by a multidisciplinary team comprised of Dr. Christophe Darnault (Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences), Dr. Brunela Rodrigues (Wood Utilization and Biomaterials), Dr. Michael Stoner (Civil Engineering), and Dr. Jim Anderson (James C. Kennedy Waterfowl and Wetlands Conservation Center).  \n\nQUALIFICATIONS: B.S. (for M.S.) and M.S. (for Ph.D.) in Environmental or Civil Engineering, Materials Science, Wood Science, Forest Engineering, Environmental Science, or a closely related field. Minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.00. A strong interest and experience in engineering design, material science, and design software is crucial. Interest in environmental sustainability, historic preservation, wetlands, statistics, and publishing is a plus. A valid driver’s license and reliable transportation is required. Due to current visa restrictions imposed by the United States government, you must be a United States citizen to apply for this position. \n Clemson University does not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sexual orientation, gender, pregnancy, national origin, age, or disability.

Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: A fellowship opportunity is available with the USDA Northern Forest Climate Hub (NFCH) to provide useable science and technology on climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation responses to meet the needs of communities and natural resources professionals across the Midwest and Northeast US. The primary focus of this fellowship is to create an ecosystem vulnerability assessment for priority terrestrial ecosystems across the Midwest and Northeast US. The assessment will synthesize current information from ecosystem models, published research, Indigenous Knowledge, and land managers, building on previous efforts and adopting contemporary approaches for accessibility and use. The assessment will serve as a synthesis of the best available science on climate change impacts and the vulnerability of ecosystems in the Midwest and Northeast US (20-state area corresponding to the FS Eastern Region). This information will be prepared for professional land managers, forest practitioners, land stewards, and others seeking information to integrate climate change considerations into planning and management. Notable applications include National Forest and Grassland Management Plans, State Forest Action Plans, and project-level ecosystem management. \n\nThe fellow will be a part of a team of NFCH to prepare the assessment. The fellow will also collaborate with partners across other agencies and institutions, including federal, state, tribal, conservation organizations, forest sector, and universities.  It will be essential for the fellow to balance multiple responsibilities, to clearly communicate with team members, and to be flexible to shifting priorities. The primary learning experience for the fellow will be to review literature and help write major portions of the vulnerability assessment. The fellow will be a lead author for multiple assessment chapters. Supplemental learning opportunities for the fellow will include analyzing data, developing web tools, facilitating meetings, delivering presentations, and designing outreach materials.\n\nLearning Objectives: \n\nThe participant will learn scientific and technical knowledge related to climate change trends, projections, ecosystem impacts, management implications, ecosystem vulnerability, and various implications to society. The participant will gather and apply information across a 20-state region of the Midwest and Northeast US.  \nThe participant will learn best practices for communicating technical scientific information to a professional audience, including preparing a large assessment for publication as a Forest Service General Technical Report, developing companion online tools and outreach products, and delivering presentations to diverse audiences.\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Maria Janowiak (maria.janowiak@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: September 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year and four months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $66,036 annually.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.

Sand Bluff was created to study population trends in migrant birds, although we also trap resident species as well. In a typical year 4-6,000 warblers, vireos, orioles, sparrows, thrushes, and finches are banded. The data collected by Sand Bluff Observatory is vital in helping scientists and government agencies understand the status of these birds both nationally, and internationally. Although Sand Bluff is primarily a research facility, visitors are always welcome to come watch our operation and share in the learning process.\n Purpose:\n\nSand Bluff Bird Observatory is operated entirely by volunteers and is always looking for help! Do you want to know more about birds? Do you want to know how to identify birds in the field or in the hand? Do you enjoy facilitating public education programming about the value of avian ecology? Do you want to learn about bird banding and develop your own banding skills?\n\nSand Bluff Bird Observatory offers all the above experience and more! No previous knowledge is needed to be a volunteer, just the willingness to learn at you own pace. While most volunteers help with data entry/recording, taking birds out of mist nets, or banding birds, there are many other important tasks to keep this great organization running. We have visitor education, database programming, event set up, data analysis, and technical writing that we could use your assistance with.\n\nPlease note: Sand Bluff Bird Observatory operates under a “Station Permit” issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The permit is granted to SBBO for the purpose of collecting field data on the age, sex, and populations of non-game species. While the observatory also serves as a regional environmental education resource, this function is secondary and must not interfere with the intent of permit or bird welfare. Additionally, volunteers must be certified to run mist nets and handle birds by senior volunteers. After certification, all volunteers must continue to follow bird handling and banding guidelines. It is the responsibility of all new volunteers to learn these procedures and follow them. Failure to do so may injure birds, degrade the quality of the data collected, result in revocation of banding permit, or rescinding of volunteer ability to participate in banding.  Trainees may remove and handle birds only under direct supervision by a certified observatory volunteer and will only independently remove/handle/band birds upon respective certification by station master.\n\n \n\nVolunteer Duties & Learning Opportunities:\n\n-              Assist in removing migratory and native birds from mist nets on “runs” every 45-60 minutes under ideal weather conditions, more often as conditions worsen. Learn safe and responsible bird handling techniques for mist net removal, bagging for transport to banding station, banding, and release. Birds must be processed and released as quickly as possible to mitigate stress or injury incurred by wildlife.\n-               Utilize reference materials and collective volunteer knowledge to develop bird identification skills of migratory and residential species.\n-              Assist in data collection and recording during capture and banding procedures.\n-              Adhere to all disease management procedures, including single-use and sanitation of bird bags to prevent the spread of disease.\n-              Develop skills in bird health assessment (body condition, stress, injury, etc.).\n-              Assist in public engagement programming concerning SBBO’s bird banding process and duty to conservation\n-              Assist in database programming and analysis of population, age, sex, and recapture data.\n-              Develop bird banding skills under the guidance of station master or certified volunteer.\n\n \n\nHours: Banding sessions will be conducted Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays from mid-August till the end of mid-November, starting at 07:00 am to 12:00 pm (weather permitting). Check out our website or Facebook page for more information on startup.\n \n\n\nContact\nMike Eickman\nredtail15@aol.com (preferred contact method)",

At SummitWest, the Senior Wildlife Biologist at SummitWest is a subject matter expert who will leverage their extensive experience in wildlife, botanical,  or wetland field surveys to support natural resource projects throughout California and occasionally in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, and beyond.\n\nThe Senior Wildlife Biologist will lead field surveys, mentor junior staff, guide project planning, and assist with report preparation, permitting, and client coordination. This position requires exceptional organizational skills, flexibility, and a collaborative spirit to manage projects in a variety of terrains and weather conditions. \n\nIf you’re motivated by dynamic challenges, enjoy mentoring the next generation of professionals, and excel at driving compliance success in the field, this is the opportunity for you.\n\nROLE DESCRIPTION & DUTIES:\nThe Senior Wildlife Biologist will conduct diverse natural resource tasks under the guidance of Project Managers, Environmental Coordinators, and Environmental Schedulers. Duties include but are not limited to:\n\nKEY RESPONSIBILITIES:\nConstruction Monitoring: Oversee environmental compliance during construction, including worker awareness programs, pre-construction surveys, and real-time site monitoring.\nField Surveys: Conduct botanical, wildlife, and/or wetland field surveys across a variety of diverse terrains and weather conditions.\nEndangered Species and Habitat Surveys: Perform presence/absence and protocol-level surveys for specialized species, requiring Recovery permits. \nData Collection and Management: Utilize ESRI software and other tools for data collection, quality control (QC), and report writing.\nCompliance Support: Provide biological desktop reviews, create permitting packages, assist with GIS mapping, and ensure adherence to regulatory requirements.\nProject Oversight: Guide proposal submissions, budget development, project planning, and assist in bid interviews and client meetings.\nTeam Collaboration: Maintain open and concise communication with project teams, contractors, and clients.\nReporting: Prepare technical studies, daily monitoring reports, and compliance documentation.\nMentorship and Leadership: Train and mentor junior staff while serving as a subject matter expert for technical guidance.\nQuality Control: Conduct thorough reviews of field data and reports to ensure accuracy and timeliness.\n\nADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES:\nProvide biological desktop support, including assisting with project management tasks.\nTravel to various project sites throughout California and occasionally to other states, including Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, and beyond.\nPerform biological survey fieldwork for wildlife, botanical resources, and habitat assessments, including presence/absence surveys, and endangered species surveys, independently or as part of a team.\nMonitor environmental compliance by coordinating with project managers, engineers, and construction contractors.

The historian at JODA will engage in researching and writing a comprehensive history of how JODA has been managed from 1996 to the present day, including important issues in planning, land acquisition, development, public relations, and other topics of ongoing management concern. The final narrative reference will consist of a scholarly examination of the administrative history of the unit and will serve as a valuable tool for future park managers and scholars. The research effort resulting from this project will significantly expand the site’s reference and archival files and provide additional information for park staff. Finally, the administrative history will be placed on JODA’s website to make the information widely available to the public.\nA chronology of land acquisitions, paleontology research, archaeology surveys, park developments, special programs, resource protection and mitigation, and personnel changes are necessary to conduct many aspects of everyday park operations as well as in preparation for the Park’s 50-year anniversary in 2025. There has been a high degree of turnover at the Park recently. As such, there has been a great deal of loss of institutional memory. Having a new administrative history will help capture institutional knowledge and prevent further loss. The historian will create a published scholarly, and comprehensively updated report bridging the gap between the last administrative history report, in 1996, and the present. This report will be a substantial aid in the documentation of the history of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.\nDescription:\nThe updated administrative history will include photos and graphics as well as a comprehensive assessment of primary and secondary sources in local, regional, state and national archives.  Oral history interviews will be conducted with present and former NPS staff, park partners, volunteers and others. These interviews will require travel to meet individuals both within the commuting distance of the park and outside of it. The study will be prepared by a professional historian who meets the Secretary of the Interior’s standards for historians and follows the guidelines outlined in Director’s Order 28.\nProject Objectives:\nThis project will result in a published scholarly, and comprehensively updated report bridging the gap between the 1996 report and the present and will be a substantial aid in the documentation of the history of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. This historic report will research and document cultural resources of the park from 1996 to present and is a baseline document.

This project is based at three long-term ecohydrological research sites (Soaproot, Newt Creek, and Providence), which are managed by the PSWRS of the USDA FS in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nAt the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: The participant will engage in field-based research examining the impacts of wildfire and drought-induced tree mortality on water quality and quantity in headwater forest ecosystems.\n\nThe participant will collect water and gas samples from boreholes, soils, and streams, with a focus on capturing spatiotemporal variation in hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to disturbance. Specific activities will include participating in field campaigns to monitor moisture dynamics, collecting and analyzing water samples for major ions, nutrients, water stable isotopes, and carbon isotopes, and assisting in the maintenance and calibration of field instrumentation.\n\nLaboratory activities will involve preparing and analyzing samples using techniques such as ion chromatography and isotope ratio spectroscopy. The participant will collaborate closely with graduate students and project collaborators to synthesize results, compare site responses, and contribute to research on how forest structure and climate extremes shape water availability and watershed function.\n\nLearning Objectives: This opportunity will provide training in hydrologic instrumentation, sample analysis, and environmental data interpretation, supporting the agency’s mission to advance science-based forest and water resource management.\n\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is David Dralle (david.dralle@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for 3 months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $16,251.10 monthly.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service.

These positions can start as early as the end of July and will run through the middle of November. The start date is flexible. As a research intern, you will contribute to ongoing field experiments and interact with professors, post-docs, and graduate students. If you are a recently graduated student with a background or interest in biology, ecology, environmental science, botany, soil science, or related field we encourage you to apply.\n\nPay is $15.50 per hour. Typical workdays are eight hours Monday through Friday. Most of the work you do will be out in the field, though a few jobs have indoor laboratory or computer components. On-site dormitory housing is available to rent.\n\nResearch Overview\nWe have three large scale projects and several smaller scale LTER experiments that require most of our intern resources. BioCON is one of the large-scale experiments where we explore the ways in which plant communities respond to environmental changes such as increased nitrogen deposition, increased atmospheric CO2, decreased biodiversity, altered precipitation patterns, and increased temperatures. Another large-scale project is the Big Biodiversity experiment that studies how plant diversity affects the rates, dynamics, and stability of ecological processes at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. Other experiments nested within the Big Biodiversity look at factors such as irrigation and increased temperatures. The third large scale experiment, FAB, is looking at tree competition under different diversity levels.

Grand Rapids is a small, rural community in north-central Minnesota. The Forestry Sciences Laboratory is located on the University of Minnesota North Central Research and Outreach Center adjacent to the Minnesota North Community College - Itasca Campus. \n\nAt the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: The chemistry laboratory in the Grand Rapids Forestry Sciences Laboratory supports studies of forest and resource management. The office is part of the Research and Development program of the Northern Research Station (NRS) of the USDA Forest Service. The primary opportunity of the fellows will be to participate in the preparation of samples for chemical analysis and learn a range of skills associated with a chemistry laboratory. Samples may be soils, sediments, plant tissues, or water collected from studies. In addition to research of NRS scientists, the laboratory supports analysis for the NRS Forest Inventory and Analysis Program, the Air Resource Monitoring Program, other cooperating federal agencies, and academic partners. The opportunity will include cataloging and organization of incoming samples, processing and preparing samples for analysis and entering of data produced during analysis. Fellows will collaborate with the laboratory manager (chemist), a physical sciences technician, and other staff associated with mentoring by a hydrologist/project leader (supervisor of all staff within the local research unit).\n\nLearning Objectives: Fellows arriving with more advanced skills and experience with chemical analysis may be provided the opportunity to learn about instrument calibration, operation, and data quality control/quality assurance procedures, or operate analytical instruments for the measurement for basic inorganic solutes/constituents and nutrients. The fellow/s will be exposed to both research and research operations support, which are both germane to gaining insight of routine stages of many different science support positions within research institutions, whether in a federal government research agency, academia, or the commercial sector. \n\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Stephen Sebestyen (stephen.sebestyen@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: September 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is part time. The opportunity is in the range of 10 to 20 hours per week, with flexible hours within period between 6:30 AM to 4:30 PM, weekdays only, typically during the academic year (fall and spring semesters only).  A fellow is expected to reliably complete the agreed upon total hours per month (based upon 10-20 hr per week).\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $680 per month, but contingent on participation level.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals.

We expect that the participant will use econometric methods to approach this research objective.\n\nLearning Objectives: The ORISE participant will learn about relevant fire prevention programs, fire prevention activities, and associated datasets. In addition, the participant will receive guidance with novel econometric techniques, and receive support with scientific writing.\n\nThe participant will have the opportunity to collaborate and receive mentorship from scientists and mangers in USFS and Bureau of Indian Affairs. The participant will develop scientific writing and econometric skills, as well as increase proficiency using statistical software (such as STATA or R). The mentor will encourage dissemination of results among managers and research groups.  \n\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Sonia Bruck (sonia.bruck@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be until December 30, 2025, but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is part time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $3,000-$3,500 per month.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation. Foreign national candidates may have a mandatory in-person requirement depending on visa status.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.

Our research focuses on quantifying vegetation dynamics over space and time and identifying how the relative importance of ecological processes structuring plant communities changes with spatial and temporal scale. In addition, a key goal of our research is to understand how pattern and process in plant communities will be altered in the face of global environmental change. An important motivation for our work is to address ecological questions at large spatial scales to inform landscape conservation. We collect field data, use existing large observational data sets, and implement simulation modeling to address these goals in temperate shrublands, wetlands, woodlands, and forests. Additional information about the lab can be found at http://www.kylepalmquist.org/.\n RESEARCH FOCUS: The successful candidate will explore the interacting effects of sea-level rise and increased storm surge on coastal vegetation and the effects of prescribed fire on pine-dominated vegetation on Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island (MCRDPI), a sea-island in South Carolina. Coastal vegetation provides important ecosystem services, including storm protection, erosion control, and habitat for wildlife. These complex, highly zoned plant communities are structured by multiple environmental factors including salinity, elevation, soil texture, soil moisture, exposure, and light availability. Sea-level rise and intensification of the hydrologic cycle (i.e. more frequent and intense storms) is expected to affect the distribution and composition of coastal vegetation in the future, with important implications. Prescribed fire has been implemented in pine woodlands and forests on the island to enhance their resilience to climate change and to restore their structure from closed forests to open woodlands. The effects of prescribed fire have yet to be assessed. The project will integrate remote sensing, plant community sampling, and modeling to quantify how sea-level rise and associated factors have impacted coastal vegetation up to present and how climate change may influence vegetation in the future. An additional goal is to assess how prescribed fire is influencing pine-dominated vegetation on the island by installing and re-sampling permanent vegetation plots.   \n PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS: A background, including relevant course work, in botany or plant ecology, and GIS or remote sensing, strong communication skills, and strong quantitative skills. Experience in remote sensing and GIS and knowledge of the southeastern US flora is highly desirable.\n EXPECTATIONS: The successful candidate will be expected to conduct high-quality research, serve as a teaching assistant within the Department of Biological Sciences, present their research to the scientific community at regional and national meetings, and publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n TIMELINE: The position is available starting January 2026 and possibly before.\n FUNDING: Funding will consist of a combination of research and teaching assistantships for two years. A 12-month competitive stipend ($20,000), and full tuition waiver will be provided. The student is responsible for covering University fees.\n HOW TO APPLY: Interested students should apply by submitting the following to Dr. Kyle Palmquist (palmquist@marshall.edu): 1) short statement of research interests and career goals (no longer than 1 page), 2) CV, 3) unofficial transcripts, and 4) contact information for three professional references. Please include: “MS position – coastal vegetation” and your name in the email subject.\n Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until a candidate is selected. I will contact you to discuss your research interests and goals for graduate school if I determine you would be a good fit for the lab. If selected, a full application must be submitted to the Department of Biological Sciences at Marshall University, Huntington, WV.

Additional information about the lab can be found at http://www.kylepalmquist.org/. \n RESEARCH FOCUS: The successful candidate will broadly explore the interacting effects of climate change, wildfire, and livestock grazing intensity on big sagebrush plant communities throughout their spatial extent in the western US. These water-limited ecosystems are undergoing rapid environmental change due to multiple stressors (climate change, increases in wildfire activity, species invasions) and represent some of the most threatened systems in North America. This project is supported by a five-year NSF grant and will leverage an individual-based plant simulation model to quantify the impacts of multiple global change drivers on big sagebrush plant communities under future conditions. Potential focal projects the MS student would lead include: the role of competition in altering plant functional type responses to global change drivers and the implications for shrub-grass coexistence or leveraging livestock grazing as a tool to prevent the spread of invasive species and decrease wildfire risk under a future climate. This project will provide collaborative opportunities with ecologists at Yale University, and with scientists and managers from multiple federal agencies (BLM, USGS, USFWS, USFS, USDA ARS). \n REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS: A background and relevant course work in ecology and statistics, knowledge and experience in sagebrush ecosystems of the western U.S., strong communication skills, and strong quantitative skills.

When wildfires occur, millions of people may be exposed to unhealthy and sometimes hazardous air quality conditions, often for days or weeks. Yet, wildland fire is also a natural part of many ecosystems. Prescribed burning is used in various regions of the US to maintain ecosystem health, as well as a means of protecting people and resources from wildfire.\n\nWe are looking for a fellow to participate in a project that seeks to substantially upgrade and expand the suite of tools available for documenting and forecasting wildland fire smoke transport and dispersion. The project objective is to improve both wildfire and prescribed fire operational decision support in various landscapes. They will interact with a team focused on developing new systems and novel techniques and tools, such as improving smoke modeling systems through a variety of means. This may include multi-model approaches, statistical and machine learning, coupled fire behavior/fire atmosphere modeling, air quality modeling, and system evaluation. Depending on their skills and interests, they can participate in various aspects of the project, including an upgraded fire tracking system; improved estimates of fire emissions that include uncertainty bounds suitable to emissions inventories; and more accurate and advanced smoke modeling capabilities.\n\nLearning Objectives: The fellow will develop professionally while engaging in research-operational partnerships and learning about systems involving air quality monitoring, fire emissions, and smoke modeling developed through the USFS Fire and Aviation Management-led Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program. They will gain experience with complex datasets from surface observational systems, remote sensing systems, including recent NOAA and NASA satellite launches, and computer modeling systems. \n\nMentor: The mentors for this opportunity are Susan O’Neill (susan.oneill1@usda.gov), Sim Larkin (sim.larkin@usda.gov), Tony Bova (anthony.bova@usda.gov), Brian Potter (brian.potter@usda.gov).

(AIS) is a national scientific services firm supporting maritime activities requiring certification of compliance with environmental regulations as well as collecting data for use by Federal, State, Municipal, and other government agencies along the US coastline.\n\nAIS is looking for a Sr. Fisheries Physiologist to assist in the planning of and preparations for lab-based behavior studies with living marine resources in support of the Ecosystems and Aquaculture Division (EAD).\n\nPrimary Function:\nThe EAD supports research themes including the processes linking spatial and temporal patterns in climate with regional and local responses of species and their habitats. Sound originating from anthropogenic activities in the world’s oceans is increasing and so there is increased attention being paid to its ecological consequences. This is a particular concern in previously undeveloped areas of the oceans. Most of this concern has focused on the effects/impacts on marine mammal and protected species which excludes the far larger biomass and economic importance of other fish and invertebrates. Criteria and metrics employed for the use on these fishes and invertebrates have often had to be assumed and key information is lacking towards understanding disruption in such behaviors as feeding and breeding. A candidate is needed to support work towards filling these research gaps.\n\nDuties/Responsibilities:\nLeads the development and execution of advanced experimental designs, adapting as needed.\nConceives and leads large, multi-year, multi-partner research initiatives as a Co-PI and writes grant proposals, ensuring alignment with NOAA and project goals.\nSupervises junior contractor staff and mentors contractor interns or volunteers.\nParticipates in lab experiments to collect physiological and behavioral data from fish held in research aquaria, including experience with Auditory Brainstem Response experiments using Tucker Davis Technologies System III tools and/or Loligo Systems intermittent flow respirometry equipment.\nOrganizes field sample collection of fish and habitat, potentially including image and genetic data.\nAssists in the planning of and preparations for lab-based fish metabolism, hearing, and/or acoustic behavioral and physiological studies with living marine resources.\nCalculates vital physiological rates, sound pressure, and/or particle motion stimulus intensity levels from software and/or hydrophone and geophone recordings during experiments.\nPublishes research in peer-reviewed journals and co-presents at national conferences.\nBuilds and maintains collaborator networks to enhance project success.\n Compensation: Candidates will be paid an hourly rate to be negotiated, and total compensation will vary depending on the candidates’ depth of experience. This is a full–time position. AIS benefits package includes health and dental insurance, vacation, sick and holiday benefits. \n\nMinimum Qualifications:\nDoctoral degree (PhD.) in Biology, Marine Science, Physiology, Neuroscience, or related fields and 5+ years of experience.\nProven experience in experimental design and statistical analysis.\nDemonstrated ability to publish technical reports and peer-reviewed journal articles\nFamiliar with fish tagging techniques (tbar, anchor, elastomer, pit)\nBasic knowledge of plumbing, valves and piping and how to connect them.\nCapable and willing to do physical work in indoor/outdoor spaces, semi enclosed spaces and possible on a sea-going vessel.\nDrives government vehicles (requires valid driver’s license).\nLift up to 50 lbs.\nWorks irregular hours, shift work, and on weekends if experiments require.\n\nPreferred Qualifications:\nExperience with spawning, husbandry, and general maintenance of marine finfish and shellfish adults and early life-stages in a captive, culture-based environment.\n\nTravel:\nDomestic and international travel may be required as follows: attendance at regional, national and international stock assessment related meetings, project-related workshops and working group meetings.\n\nLocation:\n78 Magruder Road, Highlands NJ 07732\n Contact:\nIf you would like to apply for this exciting new opening, please visit our Careers Page to submit the required information:\n\nResume\nCover letter detailing relevant experience.\n3 professional references (name, email address and phone number)\n\nAll documents must be submitted for your application to be considered.

Our research focuses on quantifying vegetation dynamics over space and time and identifying how the relative importance of ecological processes structuring plant communities changes with spatial and temporal scale. In addition, a key goal of our research is to understand how pattern and process in plant communities will be altered in the face of global environmental change. An important motivation for our work is to address ecological questions at large spatial scales to inform landscape conservation. We collect field data, use existing large observational data sets, and implement simulation modeling to address these goals in temperate shrublands, wetlands, woodlands, and forests. Additional information about the lab can be found at http://www.kylepalmquist.org/. \n RESEARCH FOCUS: The successful candidate will broadly explore the interacting effects of climate change, wildfire, and livestock grazing intensity on big sagebrush plant communities throughout their spatial extent in the western US via ecological modeling. These water-limited ecosystems are undergoing rapid environmental change due to multiple stressors (climate change, increases in wildfire activity, species invasions) and represent some of the most threatened systems in North America. This project is supported by a five-year NSF CAREER grant and will leverage an individual-based plant simulation model (STEPWAT2) to quantify the impacts of multiple global change drivers on big sagebrush plant communities under future conditions. Potential focal projects include but are not limited to: investigating the role of competition in altering plant functional type responses to global change drivers and the implications for shrub-grass coexistence, identifying the likelihood of ecosystem state transitions under a future climate, and investigating how livestock grazing can be used as a tool to maintain native plant cover and prevent invasion by non-native species. This project will provide collaborative and networking opportunities with ecologists at Yale University, and with scientists and managers from multiple federal agencies (BLM, USGS, USFWS, USFS, USDA ARS). \n REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS: \n·      A PhD in ecology or a related field with relevant course work in ecology and statistics and a demonstrated publication record in these fields\n·      Knowledge of and/or experience working in sagebrush ecosystems of the western U.S.\n·      Strong quantitative skills and experience in ecological modeling and computer programming in R and Unix environments\n·      Excellent organizational skills, attention to detail, and ability to work both independently and collaboratively in a team environment\n·      Strong written and verbal communication skills\n EXPECTATIONS: The successful candidate will be expected to conduct high-quality research, present their research to the scientific community at regional and national meetings, publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and mentor undergraduate and graduate students in collaborative settings. The candidate will have the opportunity to gain additional teaching experience in the Department of Biological Sciences, at a minimum by presenting their research via guest lectures within Palmquist’s existing ecology classes (Principles of Ecology, Plant Ecology). The candidate will also be expected to participate in educational and outreach activities with Marshall University undergraduates and the Northern Arapaho tribes in Wyoming.\n TIMELINE: The position is available starting March 2026 and must be filled no later than June 2026.\n FUNDING: Funding is available for two years and five months at $55,000 per year. Full benefits (health insurance and retirement) will be provided. Funding beyond one year will be contingent on satisfactory job performance.\n LOCATION: The position will be based at Marshall University in Huntington, WV. For the right candidate, remote work may be considered.\n Marshall University is located in Huntington, an affordable college town located on the Ohio River in the beautiful state of West Virginia. The town is small enough to get around on foot and bike, but large enough to support a variety of restaurants and other cultural activities. Huntington and the surrounding area offer ample recreational opportunities (hiking, skiing, rafting), along with proximity to larger cities, including Louisville, KY, Cincinnati, OH, and Columbus, OH. In the Palmquist Lab, we highly value and encourage work-life balance. Faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences have expertise in a variety of biological fields, including but not limited to ecology, evolution, herpetology, and physiology. More information about the Department and its programs can be found here: https://www.marshall.edu/biology/.\n HOW TO APPLY: Interested individuals should apply by submitting the following to Dr. Kyle Palmquist (palmquist@marshall.edu). Please include: “Postdoc position - dryland plant communities” and your name in the email subject.\n 1) cover letter describing research interests and career goals (no longer than 2 pages)\n2) CV\n3) unofficial transcripts\n4) up to three representative peer-reviewed publications (in press or published)\n5) contact information for three professional references\n Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until a candidate is selected.

Add to that learning a new set of skills and gaining great field experience at one of the longest-running parrot projects in the Americas? If this sounds good to you, come and join our team of dedicated volunteers!\n\nFor over two decades, we’ve been working in the lowlands of southeastern Peru, led by Drs. Brightsmith and Vigo-Trauco from Texas A&M’s Schubot Center for Avian Health. Our research focuses on the breeding ecology of wild parrots and macaws in Tambopata, a region critical to conservation since 1999.\n\nVolunteers are the backbone of our work, contributing thousands of hours to understanding these incredible birds. Whether you’re passionate about wildlife, have a background in biology, or are just eager to gain field experience, we welcome you to be part of this rewarding journey.\n\nWith various programs designed for all experience levels—from birdwatching enthusiasts to graduate-level professionals—there’s an opportunity for everyone who’s responsible, enthusiastic, and ready for an adventure in conservation. Are you ready for a hands-on conservation experience in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth? Come join us in making a real difference!\n\nWe have different volunteer assistantships programs that require different levels of experience from amateur enthusiasts and birdwatchers to graduate-level professionals. Volunteer activities vary according to the position.\n\nLONG TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT\n\n Join our team and be trained to identify all local parrots by sight and sound. You’ll conduct parrot censuses in the forest and at clay licks, locate foraging parrots, and enter collected data into our system. During the macaw breeding season, you’ll learn to climb trees using rope systems and observe macaw behavior around nests. Additional duties include campsite setup and cooking. \n\nSHORT VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT\n\nIn this role, you will receive quick training to assist our field team in monitoring macaw nests from the ground, supporting the team that works with ropes. You will also be trained to monitor macaw behavior around nests and help with clay lick observations. Due to the shorter stay, involvement in activities like parrot censuses and tree climbing will be limited. Other responsibilities include campsite setup and cooking.\n\nSPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION\n\nBe part of the “Harrison's Bird Foods Internship in the Rainforest Program”! You will receive comprehensive training similar to our long-term volunteers, including parrot identification, conducting censuses, monitoring foraging behaviors, tracking tree species macaws use, and entering data. In addition to tree climbing and nest observation, you’ll also assist with macaw chick health checks, including taking biometric measurements. You’ll play a key role in our nest monitoring expeditions throughout the Tambopata River basin. As with all positions, activities include campsite setup and cooking. \n\nQUALIFICATIONS\n\nLONG-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS:\n\nCandidates must have previous field experience and experience working with birds. A degree in Biology, Ecology, Forestry, Wildlife Sciences, or a related field, or be close to graduation, is required. \n\nAdditional Requirements: Volunteers should be in good physical condition, able to carry a 40 lb (18 kg) pack over moderate terrain for up to 2 km, and must have no fear of heights, particularly during the macaw breeding season (Dec-Mar). They should be able to work well in a team, handle stressful and challenging situations, and have travel insurance coverage\n\nSHORT-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS \n\nApplicants should have some experience observing animals, either in the wild or in captivity, along with an appreciation for nature and wildlife. \n\nAdditional Requirements:   \nVolunteers need to be in average physical condition, capable of walking 2 km over moderate terrain. They should have strong observational skills, the ability to remain seated for long periods of time, and a basic knowledge of birds. Travel insurance coverage is also required.\n\nSPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION\n\nThis position is available immediately, with a start date of November 28, 2024. Candidates must have previous field experience and experience working with birds, along with a degree or be in the final semesters of studies in Biology, Ecology, Forestry, or a related field. Some level of Spanish proficiency is also necessary.\n\nAdditional Requirements: Volunteers must be in good physical condition, able to carry a 40 lb (18 kg) pack over moderate terrain for up to 2 km and have no fear of heights (Dec-May). They should have a positive attitude toward facing new and challenging situations, be able to work well in a team under stress and have travel insurance coverage.\n\nACCOMODATIONS\n\nOur headquarters are located in the Malinoski Biological Station which is located right where the Malinoski river joins the Tambopata River. The station is a two-story wooden house with electricity generated by a gasoline generator and 75 Gb internet. The rooms are for two people and bathrooms and showers are shared. The first floor has a large area for common use of the different teams of researchers who stay there.\n\nCOST\nEssentially, volunteering is free. We take care of research permit costs, cover the costs of all staff, work to maintain training material, and also deal with all correspondence and various aspects of project management. However, our budget does not extend to being able to pay for all aspects of volunteer participation. As such you only need to cover food, accommodation, and other services provided by the field station. The costs are very reasonable. The daily fee is according to the position and experience:\n\n• Long-term assistant: 30 USD/day \n\n• Short-term assistant: 45 USD/day \n\n• SPONSORED Long-term assistant: NO COST (Thanks to the generous sponsorship from Harrison's Bird Foods) \n\n\n*A one-time processing fee of $30 will be added for all volunteers.\nThis rate covers food (3 meals per day) and accommodations (bedding is provided). All volunteers will be charged an airport transfer to be picked up ($20) or dropped off ($10) at the airport plus an extra cost to be transported to the port in private transportation ($45). Once a volunteer was accepted, they will be sent an invoice by email from Texas A&M University. Upon receipt, the volunteer needs to pay 20% of the total cost of their stay. This non-refundable payment is required to hold the reservation for the assistant. The remaining 80% of the payment should be made at least two weeks before the assistant arrives at the release site. Arrangements can be made if assistants wish to pay in cash in the country. However, prior permission from the coordinator is needed. Changes to the daily fee may apply according to availability and season\n\n  Contact\nDr. Gabriela Vigo-Trauco\nvolunteering@themacawsociety.org (preferred contact method)",

Add to that learning a new set of skills and gaining great field experience at one of the longest-running parrot projects in the Americas? If this sounds good to you, come and join our team of dedicated volunteers!\n\nFor over two decades, we’ve been working in the lowlands of southeastern Peru, led by Drs. Brightsmith and Vigo-Trauco from Texas A&M’s Schubot Center for Avian Health. Our research focuses on the breeding ecology of wild parrots and macaws in Tambopata, a region critical to conservation since 1999.\n\nVolunteers are the backbone of our work, contributing thousands of hours to understanding these incredible birds. Whether you’re passionate about wildlife, have a background in biology, or are just eager to gain field experience, we welcome you to be part of this rewarding journey.\n\nWith various programs designed for all experience levels—from birdwatching enthusiasts to graduate-level professionals—there’s an opportunity for everyone who’s responsible, enthusiastic, and ready for an adventure in conservation. Are you ready for a hands-on conservation experience in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth? Come join us in making a real difference!\n\nWe have different volunteer assistantships programs that require different levels of experience from amateur enthusiasts and birdwatchers to graduate-level professionals. Volunteer activities vary according to the position.\n\nLONG TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT\n\n Join our team and be trained to identify all local parrots by sight and sound. You’ll conduct parrot censuses in the forest and at clay licks, locate foraging parrots, and enter collected data into our system. During the macaw breeding season, you’ll learn to climb trees using rope systems and observe macaw behavior around nests. Additional duties include campsite setup and cooking. \n\nSHORT VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT\n\nIn this role, you will receive quick training to assist our field team in monitoring macaw nests from the ground, supporting the team that works with ropes. You will also be trained to monitor macaw behavior around nests and help with clay lick observations. Due to the shorter stay, involvement in activities like parrot censuses and tree climbing will be limited. Other responsibilities include campsite setup and cooking. \n\nSPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION\n\nBe part of the “Harrison's Bird Foods Internship in the Rainforest Program”! You will receive comprehensive training similar to our long-term volunteers, including parrot identification, conducting censuses, monitoring foraging behaviors, tracking tree species macaws use, and entering data. In addition to tree climbing and nest observation, you’ll also assist with macaw chick health checks, including taking biometric measurements. You’ll play a key role in our nest monitoring expeditions throughout the Tambopata River basin. As with all positions, activities include campsite setup and cooking. \n\nQUALIFICATIONS\n\nLONG-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS:\n\nCandidates must have previous field experience and experience working with birds. A degree in Biology, Ecology, Forestry, Wildlife Sciences, or a related field, or be close to graduation, is required. \n\nAdditional Requirements: Volunteers should be in good physical condition, able to carry a 40 lb (18 kg) pack over moderate terrain for up to 2 km, and must have no fear of heights, particularly during the macaw breeding season (Dec-Mar). They should be able to work well in a team, handle stressful and challenging situations, and have travel insurance coverage\n\nSHORT-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS \n\nApplicants should have some experience observing animals, either in the wild or in captivity, along with an appreciation for nature and wildlife. \n\nAdditional Requirements:   \nVolunteers need to be in average physical condition, capable of walking 2 km over moderate terrain. They should have strong observational skills, the ability to remain seated for long periods of time, and a basic knowledge of birds. Travel insurance coverage is also required.\n\nSPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION\n\nThis position is available immediately, with a start date of November 28, 2024. Candidates must have previous field experience and experience working with birds, along with a degree or be in the final semesters of studies in Biology, Ecology, Forestry, or a related field. Some level of Spanish proficiency is also necessary.\n\nAdditional Requirements: Volunteers must be in good physical condition, able to carry a 40 lb (18 kg) pack over moderate terrain for up to 2 km and have no fear of heights (Dec-May). They should have a positive attitude toward facing new and challenging situations, be able to work well in a team under stress and have travel insurance coverage.\n\nACCOMODATIONS\n\nOur headquarters are located in the Malinoski Biological Station which is located right where the Malinoski river joins the Tambopata River. The station is a two-story wooden house with electricity generated by a gasoline generator and 75 Gb internet. The rooms are for two people and bathrooms and showers are shared. The first floor has a large area for common use of the different teams of researchers who stay there.\n\nCOST\nEssentially, volunteering is free. We take care of research permit costs, cover the costs of all staff, work to maintain training material, and also deal with all correspondence and various aspects of project management. However, our budget does not extend to being able to pay for all aspects of volunteer participation. As such you only need to cover food, accommodation, and other services provided by the field station. The costs are very reasonable. The daily fee is according to the position and experience:\n\n• Long-term assistant: 30 USD/day \n\n• Short-term assistant: 45 USD/day \n\n• SPONSORED Long-term assistant: NO COST (Thanks to the generous sponsorship from Harrison's Bird Foods) \n\n\n*A one-time processing fee of $30 will be added for all volunteers.\nThis rate covers food (3 meals per day) and accommodations (bedding is provided). All volunteers will be charged an airport transfer to be picked up ($20) or dropped off ($10) at the airport plus an extra cost to be transported to the port in private transportation ($45). Once a volunteer was accepted, they will be sent an invoice by email from Texas A&M University. Upon receipt, the volunteer needs to pay 20% of the total cost of their stay. This non-refundable payment is required to hold the reservation for the assistant. The remaining 80% of the payment should be made at least two weeks before the assistant arrives at the release site. Arrangements can be made if assistants wish to pay in cash in the country. However, prior permission from the coordinator is needed. Changes to the daily fee may apply according to availability and season\n\n\nContact\nDr. Gabriela Vigo-Trauco\nvolunteering@themacawsociety.org (preferred contact method)",

While all conservation actions on the ground must eventually be applied at the site scale, the “landscape-scale” has been recommended for decades as a suitable scale for planning. The landscape scale brings in ecological and socioeconomic context to inform decisions by understanding ecological connections and flows, population-level information about species, human stressors affecting sites but originating outside of them, and policy. This course will explore the key concepts and some tricky challenges of conducting conservation planning at the landscape scale, including how site-scale implementing actions can flow from a landscape-scale plan.  The course will draw on the Conservation Standards and other frameworks but will address the multi-disciplinary needs and tools of landscape planning including spatial analyses and optimization, incorporating socioeconomic factors and community input, the importance of partners, and how to sustain what must be a dynamic effort into the future. Eight guest instructors from multiple organizations around the world will augment the course with their specific expertise and experience. \n DATES \nSTANDARD and PREMIUM formats:\nLive (recorded) meetings 24 September – 22 October, 2025; 11:00 a.m. – 1:00 p.m. EDT on Wednesdays and Fridays each week (except October 8).

Topics may include watersheds, migrations, adaptations, forest forensics, and more!\n\nTranslating Park Publications:\nThe second project for the Latino Heritage Intern would be to translate park publications and maps from English to Spanish.

The intern will be given time and support to develop pop-up programs, beach programs, and/or an introductory Spanish-language Junior Ranger Program to engage families in lessons and activities about river safety. (Over the past three years, there have been five visitor drownings at DEWA, with 40% of the victims speaking Spanish as their first language.)\n\nAdditionally, DEWA is partnering with Latino Outdoors, Outdoor Afro, and NPCA to provide guided hikes. The Latino Heritage Intern would prepare for the hikes with the park’s supervisory ranger and have the opportunity to coordinate, lead, and strengthen visitor relationships with resources and recreational opportunities.

Its primary purpose is to serve the original needs of the NGO’s operations which are wildlife conservation through research and education. This is accomplished through the layout of the farm which provides extensive wildlife habitat and foraging opportunities, increasing the local faunal biodiversity as well as acting as an educational demonstration to local subsistence farmers and visiting students.  \nInterns will learn by assisting in implementation and evaluation of management practices, cropping, and record keeping on the farm with this vision in mind while we endeavor to maximize the products coming from the farm with the existing design and layout using sustainable and regenerative practices specific to the Mesoamerican uplands. Within this broad framework, intern projects can include several basic Agricultural Education disciplines including Tropical Agriculture, Sustainable/organic Agriculture, Farm Management, Waste management, and Agricultural Economics.  \nIn addition to planting crops, we also have free range chickens and ducks for eggs and meat. We are looking to increase our revenue generation from the farm either in the form of increased accountable products entering our kitchen for use in our restaurant, or for sale to the Mobile Market or in a proposed road-side café which would be managed by T.R.E.E.S kitchen and hospitality staff. Thus, interns would also assist us with marketing strategy for existing products and/or planting. \nBy the successful conclusion of this internship, the student will be able to apply practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species, basic free range poultry operations, evaluate different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns, and become familiar with sustainable management practices such as no/low till, cover cropping, waste management, mulching, marketing, Farm-to-Table, etc. \n Requirements: \nNo prior tropical agriculture experience required. Interns can be current undergraduate or graduate students enrolled in a program with their University/College for credit however non-students can also apply; but preference will be given to students enrolled in an accreditation program.

Our team members go above and beyond, bringing initiative, integrity, and a strong work ethic to every project. Collaboration is key—we thrive on teamwork, open communication, and diverse perspectives. In a field that constantly changes, we value those who are resilient, adaptable, and resourceful in the face of challenges. If you're intellectually curious, eager to learn, and ready to help restore ecosystems and protect natural resources, you’ll find your place here.\n\nRES is looking for a Scientist I to join our team.\n\nAs a Scientist I at RES, you’ll support field data collection, environmental monitoring, and ecological assessments that provide the foundation of our environmental, ecological, and natural resource projects. Working under the direction of experienced scientists, you’ll contribute to meaningful work in the field—collecting and processing data, supporting and reporting field efforts, and gaining exposure to environmental regulations, ecosystems, and scientific practices.\n\nThis position is an entry-level opportunity ideal for a recent graduate or someone early in their career who is passionate about environmental science, ecology, or natural resources and wants to build a strong foundation for long-term growth.\n\nThis position is based in our Fort Lauderdale, FL office, and the selected candidate is expected to work from the office via a hybrid schedule. Some travel and overnight stays are anticipated. Approximately 60-70% of your time will be spent in the field, supporting projects across South and Central Florida.\n\nWhy You’ll Love This Job\n\n \n\nYou’ll be in the field, not just behind a desk.

From GPS data collection to interpreting maps and recording results, you'll apply and expand your environmental knowledge daily.\n\nYou’ll grow with mentorship. You’ll work side-by-side with senior scientists, field leads, and project managers who are invested in helping you learn and succeed.\n\nYour work will have an impact. Incorporation of high-quality environmental data early in a project will help facilitate decisions that incorporate environmental concepts such as avoidance and minimization.\n\n \n\nA Day in the Life\n\nYour day might start prepping field gear at the office to visit a project site— a wetland mitigation site, shallow marine habitat, or upland tree area, for example. On-site you may walk transects through a wetland, record plant species, conduct a marine benthic survey, and use a GPS to mark key locations. You’ll work as part of a small field team, following sampling protocols, maintaining equipment, and ensuring every data point is accurate and well-documented. Later, you might return to the office to enter your data into Excel or another database, help process site photos and maps, or contribute notes for a technical report.\n\nYou’ll learn how environmental regulations influence what we do, and begin to understand how habitat, water quality, landscape features and habitats intersect with project planning. Over time, you’ll become more familiar with regional flora and fauna, permitting frameworks, and real-world application of scientific principles in the field.\n\n \n\nWe would like to talk to you if you have many of the following:\n\nBachelor’s degree in environmental science, biology, ecology, geology, natural resources, or a related field\n0–2 years of field experience (can include internships, academic fieldwork, or volunteer work)\nBasic knowledge of scientific methods, data collection using GPS and/ or GIS tools, and safe field practices\nFamiliarity with ecological concepts such as native species, soil profiles, or hydrology\nAbility and desire to work outdoors in varying conditions and terrain\nOpen-water diving certification\nYou will thrive in this position if you:\n\nPossess strong verbal and written communication skills for reporting and data documentation\nHave attention to detail and a commitment to high-quality data collection\nHave strong work ethic and reliability in team-based fieldwork\nWhat would make you stand out? \n\nExposure to wetland, stream, marine, or habitat assessments\nArcGIS experience\nExperience with field sampling equipment, inventories, or monitoring protocols\nUnderstanding of regional environmental regulations and permitting\n \n\nPlease note that the “Day in the Life” section is not intended to be an exhaustive list of job duties, but rather a representative snapshot of typical responsibilities and work experiences at RES.\n\nRES is an Equal Opportunity Employer and a VEVRAA Federal Contractor.

The position is unpaid, but stipends are available to cover expenses and to reward accomplishments. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will rapidly gain valuable professional experience by playing an integral role on the WRF team. Work to build WRF’s bear conservation capacity and impact on Teton National Park bears as you contribute and strengthen your conservation knowledge and skills. Gain recognition for your efforts among area partners, on the WRF website, and elsewhere, as you participate in meeting WRF’s mission, which is to increase park wildlife population viability both ex situ and in situ, working closely with National Parks and Forests, zoo partners, and park gateway communities.\n\n\nWRF operates effectively and efficiently and generates resources that enable measurable, boots-on-the-ground conservation results. The WRF Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will focus on implementation of the “I Am Bear Safe” Project in small towns neighboring Teton National Park’s gateway communities in Montana. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will collaborate with the WRF President, Director of Communications, and other team members in connection to the “I Am Bear Safe” Project.\n\n\n [https://www.wildlifeandparks.org/projects].\n\n\n“I Am Bear Safe”™ (IABS) is a multi-partner Wildlife Coexistence Strategy designed to equip National Park gateway community chambers of commerce and their member businesses (“Park Gateway Partners”) to “train people not to train bears” to get in the trouble they are in now because of human behavior—a situation that is assuring bear demise. Bears are a top attraction at many National Parks and are well-managed within the parks to avoid human interaction. But communities at the park’s edge are not sufficiently prepared or equipped for the increasing pressure of more visitors coupled with rapid development, naïve new residents, and a growing number of recreationists in bear country. Park Gateway Partner (PGP) businesses are the perfect intervention point and receive marketing benefits from participating in the IABS town-based bear stewardship effort. WRF provides customized tools (signage and SWAG) that equip PGPs to effectively intercept park visitors and recreationists and equip them to be bear stewards who act responsibly by securing attractants and following park rules for recreating in bear habitat. The IABS goal is that bears perform their natural behaviors and survive without risk and distraction caused by humans.\n\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nTrack the inventory of IABS materials distributed to PGPs in each town.\nDistribute IABS Toolkit materials to PGPs and redistribution points.\nRecruit new PGPs, as appropriate and assigned.\nField questions and relay PGP concerns to WRF.\nAttend meetings of the chamber of commerce or local partner organization on occasion.\nMail out reward IABS reward magnets to Bear Quiz-takers.\nCome up with novel ideas to make the IABS Project more effective.\n\nEducation & Experience\n\nBachelor’s degree in a relevant subject is required; graduate degree helpful.\nKnowledge and experience specific to grizzly and black bears required.\nExperience working with community-based organizations and/or local businesses.\n\nWRF Bear Conservation Specialists are asked to participate in an initial training then designate 16 hours a week to WRF and agree to work with WRF for 4 months. The Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) Should be a self-starter, ambitious, creative, productive, and dedicated to WRF’s mission. S/he must also exhibit a high degree of professionalism, accountability, and ability to follow instructions and manage time well. S/he should be friendly and approachable, well-spoken, bold, and personable.  The internship is unpaid, but stipends are provided for approved expenses and as results are achieved. \n\n\nThe Bear Conservation Specialist (Teton Country) will report to Julie Anton Randall, WRF President. Hours are flexible within the week, with the exception that PGP deliveries and communications best occur during business hours. Participation in biweekly IABS team meetings and occasional full WRF team meetings by Zoom are required.\n\nPlease send a short (less than one page) cover letter and resume with references to wildliferestorationvolunteer@gmail.com.  Please name the electronic file as follows: [Date]_BCS-Teton-Country_[Your Name].\n\nThank you for your dedication to bears and excitement about being part of the Wildlife Restoration Foundation team in Teton Country!\n\n\n\nContact\nOlivia Kramer\ninfo@wildlifeandparks.org (preferred contact method)",

We achieve this by hiring people who share a passion for justice and a healthy environment. We wield the power of law and the strength of partnership to protect people’s health; preserve magnificent places and wildlife; advance clean energy; and combat climate change. We partner with thousands of groups and supporters to take on the biggest, most precedent-setting cases across the country and have a distinguished track record of achieving significant, lasting environmental protections. We are here because the earth needs a good lawyer.\n\n\nEarthjustice’s work is currently divided into three major areas:\n\nLands, Wildlife, and Oceans focuses on cases that protect endangered species, national forests, national parks, other public lands, water resources, and the oceans.\nHealthy Communities focuses on cases that protect public health, prevent air and water pollution, and curb exposures to toxic chemicals, particularly in disproportionately impacted communities. Recently, our healthy communities work has also begun to promote sustainable food and agriculture and the rights of farm workers.\nClimate and Energy focuses on cases that encourage the swift and just transition to clean energy while challenging the reliance on coal, oil, and other dirty fuels.\n\nWe welcome all interested law students from across the country to apply for a summer law clerk position. We expect that students will work proximate to or in an office where the program is located. In some limited instances, an office may hire clerks to work in an area that is outside that team’s geographic area, but still proximate to an Earthjustice office.\n\n\nPlease note the location preferences of each litigation team in their descriptions below.\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\nSummer law clerks will have the opportunity to work with several attorneys on case development and litigation strategy. Students may draft pleadings and briefs, do legal research, develop strategy and legal theories, gather evidence, and attend client meetings and court proceedings. Earthjustice’s summer law clerk program also includes various programmatic offerings, such as in-person and virtual seminars with attorneys and guest speakers on current environmental issues, interactions with other local and regional environmental groups, and a job interview workshop.\n\n\nCompensation\n\n\nEarthjustice summer law clerkships are paid positions. The total stipend amount will be dependent on any external funding a student secures, such as through their law school’s summer funding program. Earthjustice will provide a one-time stipend at the start of the clerkship in the amount of $1,320.00 per week, minus the total amount received from any other sources and applicable taxes. The summer law clerkship is designed to be 10 weeks long at full-time hours (37.5 hours/week).\n\n\nYou are welcome to pursue outside funding. The ability to secure outside funding will not be considered as part of the hiring process.\n\n\nHow to Apply\n\n\nEligibility: Candidates must be enrolled in a U.S. law school through fall 2026 (i.e., not graduating before December 2026) and be available to commit to 10 weeks during summer 2026. Summer law clerks must work from the U.S. during their clerkship.\n\n\nEach Earthjustice litigation team participates in clerk hiring; candidates may submit applications to whichever and however many litigation teams they are interested. Please be prepared to respond to our September follow-up e-mail, requesting your ranked choice of the teams for which you have applied. Do not include such rankings within your Jobvite application.\n\n\nContact\nHR\ncontact via the web posting is preferred (see Details section)",

(Vertebrate Introductions and Novel Ecosystems) project, a collaboration across multiple universities (UH Manoa, UW, NAU, and UIUC) that began in 2014. The project is investigating temporal changes in seed dispersal and how removal of dominant invasive plants alters seed dispersal in mesic and wet forest ecosystems. Native species extinctions and non-native species introductions have dramatically changed the forest species composition. Although many native plants depend on birds for seed dispersal, on Oʻahu there are no longer any native frugivorous birds to provide this function. Instead, a suite of non-native birds are dispersing seeds. Additionally, invasive plants often dominate seed dispersal networks with impacts to native plant seed dispersal. Understanding temporal changes and how removal of invasive plant species impacts seed dispersal is critically important for restoration efforts.\n\nThere are multiple positions open with starting dates spanning August to November, with a minimum of a five-month commitment. \n\nESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:  Basic duties include: (1) conducting mist-netting of birds to collect fecal samples for diet analysis, (2) performing point counts for bird abundance, (3) bird and plant ID, (4) measuring fruit abundance, (5) measuring vegetation characteristics, (6) removing access to non-native fruit, and (7) deploying game cameras. Additional duties will include: (1) regularly checking and maintaining netting and other experimental setups, (2) ensuring accurate and consistent data recording and entry, (3) collaborating with team members for data analysis and interpretation, and (4) participating in team meetings and contributing to project planning and adjustments. Additionally, applicants will be expected to participate in regular (at least monthly) outreach and education events related to the project. \n\nThe candidate(s) selected for this position will work on a field crew of 6-9 people including other technicians, crew leader, and graduate students. Technicians must be able to work early mornings in rugged terrain in challenging field conditions. Fieldwork will involve long days of hiking and temperamental weather conditions. This is a full-time position and technicians will receive effective compensation of $14/hour, plus shared access to vehicles and the option to live in crew housing.

Recreational fishing is a core socioeconomic activity in the region, with 1 in 5 Florida anglers fishing the coastal Everglades and generating billions in economic activity. Yet, our understanding of the patterns of recreational catch and effort and their dependency on hydrology, including ongoing restoration efforts, and climate remains limited.\n\nCoastal fisheries are hypothesized to respond to both press and pulse disturbances, with pulse disturbances impacting recruitment events and press disturbances regulating overall population performance. Thus, the goals of the study, using fisheries dependent an environmental data, are threefold: 1) To examine spatiotemporal patterns in angler catch and effort in the Everglades recreational fishery, 2) To link these spatiotemporal trends to hydroclimatic drivers and restoration actions, and 3) To evaluate the utility of fisheries-dependent data and provide recommendations for future monitoring. Available data sets include a dockside angler survey that spans over 40 years and is one of the longest and most valuable fisheries-dependent datasets in Florida, along with hydrological and climate data streams.\n\nThe position provides a unique opportunity to work collaboratively in an academic institution-government agency partnership with the goal of increasing our understanding of coastal processes and restoration effects and of improving recreational fisheries management. We are part of a highly collaborative South Florida research community, composed of scientists, federal, state, private partners, and stakeholders (see http://fcelter.fiu.edu/ and https://crestcache.fiu.edu/), and thus opportunities for collaborative team science, participation in other projects, engagement with resource managers and anglers, and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students are available.\n\nRequirements: A Ph.D. in ecology, fisheries, quantitative ecology, biology, or related field is required. Applicants must have a demonstrated record of publication in peer-reviewed journals, and excellent coding skills in R. The selected candidate must pass a U.S. government tier 1 (non-sensitive) background check and complete NPS cybersecurity training. This position requires frequent in-person work at both FIU and NPS offices in Miami, FL.\n\nPreferred qualifications: The ideal candidate has excellent quantitative skills and a passion for fisheries. Experience and interest working with fisheries-dependent data, robust causation analytical approaches, stock assessment tools, using collaborative team science approaches, and engagement with anglers and resource managers are desired.\n\nHow To Apply: Please email Dr. Jenn Rehage at rehagej@fiu.edu and Dr. Rolando Santos rsantosc@fiu.edu with the subject line ‘Postdoc 2025 + your name.’ In your email, please include (as a single PDF):\n- Cover letter describing experience, interests & expertise relevant to position & career goals\n- CV with list of 3 references\n- Examples of products (peer-reviewed publications, data & code packages, GitHub repositories, popular articles, outreach products, etc.)\n\nAbout FIU & SFNRC:\nFlorida International University is Miami’s public research university and Florida’s youngest preeminent universities, and one of the youngest R1 research universities (highest research activity) in the US. FIU is also the largest majority-minority serving institution in the country, and ranked the second most impactful university in the nation, the No. 3 best public university in the US, and among the top 20 public universities contributing to the public good. The Coastal Fisheries & Seascape Labs focus on how fishes and recreational fisheries track anthropogenic disturbance and seascape change, and conducts research to inform management, conservation, and restoration efforts in partnership with stakeholders to coproduce science that is both fundamental and actionable. \n\nThe National Park Service’s South Florida Natural Resources Center has a unique science mission to address the impacts and progress of Everglades restoration, the largest and most expensive ecosystem restoration project in history.

We engage youth (age 15-17) and young adults (ages 18-30, up to 35 for veterans) in service projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. Our AmeriCorps positions provide impactful educational and service opportunities that benefit both communities and landscapes. SECC’s participants reflect the population of the Southeast region, including youth, graduates, veterans, and individuals from various ethnic and economic backgrounds.  \n SECC collaborates with land management agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, local municipalities, and non-profits to host day and camping crews. Our projects vary but include trail construction and maintenance, restoration of natural areas, invasive species removal, fire fuels reduction, fencing, herbicide applications, and more. Most projects involve strenuous manual labor and require hiking to and from the project sites daily, carrying tools and day packs.   \n    SECC camping crews serve in frontcountry and backcountry locations, often in challenging weather conditions. While hitch schedules vary by project and location, they typically follow a 9-day on, 5-day off pattern, with 10-hour shifts and scheduled breaks throughout the day. While we aim to maintain consistency, flexibility is expected as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change based on project needs.      \n    SECC is an independent, non-residential program, and crew members are responsible for securing their own housing when not in the field. On-hitch, crews manage camp chores and prepare all their own meals, with evenings often including group discussions. Members must provide their own personal outdoor gear (e.g., tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, multi-day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots), while SECC provides group camp equipment, tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC Office and project sites.   \n    Description of Duties — Position Summary \n\nSoutheast Conservation Corps (SECC) Strike Team has partnered with a range of land managers across the Southeast, including the U.S. Forest Service at Bankhead National Forest, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in South Carolina, and Tennessee State Parks. This multi-agency initiative is rooted in a shared commitment to restoring land integrity, enhancing visitor experiences, and preparing young adults for careers in conservation. \n\n\nCrews should anticipate some hitches in rugged backcountry conditions and will be camping in remote, primitive settings to complete essential conservation projects.  \n\n\n \n\n\nService Project: \n\nMembers of the Strike Team should expect a wide array of land management projects. During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors in all weather conditions, performing heavy manual labor related to environmental conservation and restoration projects.  Most projects require hiking out to project sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack. Projects can include the following, but are not limited to: \n\nBrush and log out trail corridors.  \nMitigate drainage issues through water diversion methods, stepping stones, and natural surface improvements.  \nRepair creek crossings and eroded segments to enhance trail navigability and reduce sedimentation.  \nDecommission and obscure unauthorized user-created trails.  \nTimber step installation  \nTrail tread repair and widening  \nStone stair improvements or installation  \nCommunity Service\n \n\nCrew Life:    \nSECC crews consist of 4-6 crew members and 2 crew leaders who provide project expertise, mentorship, training, and support to ensure the success of all participants.

Crew Members will set goals at the beginning of the season and review their performance through both self-evaluation and a review with their Crew Leader in the middle and at the end of their season. Evaluations will cover areas such as professionalism, responsibility and leadership, communication, engagement, productivity, safety, and equipment use.
