Nedderman Dr, Room 337 (Arlington, Texas)\nTags:\nGraduate Opportunities\nDescription\nThe Department of Biology at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) is recruiting doctoral students for Fall 2026! All PhD students are guaranteed a full five years of funding, including salary, tuition, and healthcare.\n \n Our department spans a wide range of cutting-edge topics and techniques in biological research, with four major research areas: genomics, microbiology, ecology and evolution, and cellular, molecular and developmental biology. Our PhD program focuses on training students to apply sophisticated quantitative techniques to solve research problems in these areas, giving our graduates a competitive advantage for careers in industry, government, or academia. \n Applicants can either apply to single labs (direct entry), or apply to enter the rotation program, which gives students the opportunity to conduct research in three labs before deciding which to join. Applications are due on December 1, 2025. Applicants should contact faculty and identify potential advisors before applying – you can begin by consulting the list of recruiting labs below!\n Recruiting professors include:\n Ecology and Evolutionary Biology\nJC Buckner: The IDER lab integrates genetics, morphometrics and paleontological data to understand biodiversity dynamics and adaptation in terrestrial tetrapods. Potential graduate students would contribute to our waterfowl research on consequences of introgression for population viability and the genetic basis of convergent phenotypes. Please visit our website, iderlab.org, to learn more.\n Luke Frishkoff: The Frishkoff Lab seeks to understand the evolution and maintenance of biodiversity from local communities to large geographic regions as well as how human impacts are recasting these ecological and evolutionary patterns. We conduct community ecology field research on reptiles and amphibians in Texas, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.\n Alison Ravenscraft: Our ultimate goal is to understand how the bacterial symbionts of insects impact ecosystem-level processes such as plant consumption and pollination. We study both the pairwise bug-Caballeronia symbiosis, and the entire gut microbiome of herbivorous insects (beetles, grasshoppers and caterpillars). We ask whether, when, and how environmentally acquired gut microbiota influence these insects’ responses to stressors such as extreme climates, pesticides, and natural plant defenses.\n Matt Walsh: The Walsh lab evaluates the ecological drivers of evolutionary change in killifish on the island of Trinidad and waterfleas in lakes in Alaska.\n Cellular, Molecular, and Developmental Biology\nLoic Fort: The Fort Lab investigates how human stem cells decide their fate on their journey to becoming cardiac cells. We are especially interested in understanding how physical forces influence these decisions. By combining 2D and 3D stem cell models with advanced imaging and molecular tools such as CRISPR, we aim to uncover the fundamental rules of human development and how these processes are disrupted in patients with congenital heart disease.\n Alicia Rogers: The Rogers Lab seeks to understand how small RNA-mediated gene regulation maintains robust execution of cellular and physiological processes during normal and stress conditions. We aim to establish a comprehensive map of the regulatory logic embedded within small RNA pathways that coordinates pathway homeostasis and robust gene expression.\n Anita Quintana: The Quintana lab seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms by which genetic (pathogenic) variants cause birth defects. We have a specific focus on birth defects that disrupt brain and craniofacial development. Our laboratory uses zebrafish as a model system to study development. Zebrafish are an amazing developmental model because they are fertilized outside of their mother allowing for the visualization of development in real time.\n Genomics\nTodd Castoe: Population genomics of speciation to link theory with empirical data; Population genomics of schistomiasis transmission and the impact of control measures on natural selection. Genome-wide association studies to link traits with selection in the context of speciation and hybridization. \n Jeff Demuth: The Demuth Lab studies the evolution of sex chromosomes and molecular genetics of behavior, primarily using beetles as a model system.\n Daniela Palmer: We are interested in understanding the genetic underpinnings of biodiversity, especially in sex-related traits. We study the evolution of sex chromosomes and other parts of the genome that contribute to sex-specific adaptation. Our research focuses on a group of insects known as treehoppers that show fascinating diversity in morphology, behavior, and beyond. \n (Also see Alicia Rogers)\n Microbiology\nQing Tang: Bacterial physiology, pathogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, and host interactions of human pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. We use both cell-culture and mouse models.\n (Also see Alison Ravenscraft)\n To apply, and for more information see:\nhttps://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/science/departments/biology/graduate-programs/phd-program\n About UTA: \nUT Arlington is an R1-ranked research university, the second largest institution in the University of Texas system and one of the 10 fastest growing universities in the nation.

Current fuel models often overlook invasive species, leading to inaccurate fire risk assessments and management decisions. The student will lead a Joint Fire Sciences funded project to address this gap by developing new fuel models that incorporate the impacts of invasive species on fire behavior. The student will collect temporally explicit field data on fuel parameters associated with different levels of plant invasion for multiple species, develop custom fuel models used to parameterize fire behavior models, and use large-scale available data on invasive species occurrence and wildfires to assess changes in fire regimes region wide. The field component of the study will be conducted in two locations within the Gulf Coast region: Grand Bay National Wildlife Refuge and University of Florida’s Jay Research Facility. The student will be expected to lead field work, collect and compile remotely sensed data, conduct quantitative statistical analyses, present their findings at relevant scientific conferences, complete relevant course work, and publish their findings in the peer-reviewed literature. The student will work closely with students and scientists from other labs at the University of Florida and Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve as part of a regional team. \n\nPreferred Qualifications: The successful candidate will have a BS and MS degree in ecology or a related field, a valid driver’s license, experience with fuel sampling, fire behavior modeling, and with R and GIS for statistical and spatial analyses. In addition, they will have strong writing, communication, leadership, and organization skills and the ability to work independently and as part of a team. Please submit a cover letter explaining why you are pursuing a graduate degree and why you believe our lab is the right fit for you, plus a CV, unofficial transcript, and two references to Carissa Wonkka at c.wonkka@ufl.edu. Submit documents as a single PDF file named “[your last name] PhD JFSP.pdf”. \n\nAbout us: The Wonkka Lab employs multi-scale experiments to assess the response of functional processes, energy flows, biotic relationships, and biotic-abiotic interactions within ecological communities to common restoration and management techniques. We design studies to understand the interactions among processes, vegetation, soils, insects, animals, and human decision-making that underpin complex social-ecological system dynamics. Our research supports long-term sustainable ecosystem restoration and management that is resilient to global-change related shifts in biophysical and environmental conditions, socio-political conditions, and disturbance regimes. \n\nContact\nCarissa Wonkka\nC.wonkka@ufl.edu (preferred contact method)",

The graduate student will join a large team implementing a field research project on the factors limiting and regulating moose populations in Ontario. The student project will be focused broadly on American black bear ecology with a focus on interactions with moose. Specific research questions will be determined collaboratively between the students and research team. The field project is a multi-year program that entails the GPS radio collaring of moose, American black bears, wolves and white-tailed deer to assess cause-specific mortality of moose and examine predator-prey dynamics. The successful applicant will have considerable responsibility and freedom to formulate and address basic and applied research questions grounded in ecological theory. Field work will be highly varied and will include live trapping and deployment of collars on black bears, wolves and white-tailed deer and helicopter capture of adult and calf moose. Further, the project involves deployment of remotely triggered trail cameras, collection of non-invasive samples for black bear population estimation, vegetation surveys, hunter surveys, aerial population surveys and more. The student will be expected to conduct significant field work for their specific project AND assist in all field aspects of the broader project. The student will be co-supervised by Dr. Joe Northrup and Dr. Brent Patterson both of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources & Trent University. \n\n \n\nRequirements \n\nM.Sc. degree in ecology, wildlife biology, or related field is desired, but exceptional past experience may be considered in place of a M.Sc. degree. Applicants must meet the minimum entrance requirements for the Environmental & Life Sciences graduate program at Trent University.  Desired qualifications include a GPA >3.5 (4.0 scale). A strong background in ecology, demonstrated analytical capabilities, and passion for wildlife research are required. Strong quantitative, writing, and oral communication skills are also required. The strongest applicants will have demonstrated experience publishing in peer-reviewed journals, and with programming languages commonly used for statistical and scientific applications (e.g., R and Python), and familiarity with geospatial software (e.g., ArcMap, QGIS). Applicants should be physically fit, have significant field experience, be comfortable with flying in small planes and helicopters, and be capable of working in varied terrain for extensive periods in extreme conditions (e.g., temperatures that will range between 30 and -40 C, lots of biting insects etc.). \n\nApplication instructions \n\nInitially, all applications are to be sent as follows. Please email a cover letter with an explicit statement of analytical/quantitative AND field experience and abilities, current CV, unofficial transcripts, scientific writing sample and contact info for ≥3 references as a single attachment to moose.project.applications@gmail.com. The successful applicant is expected to begin in fall, 2026. Application deadline is December 1, 2025 but review of applications will begin immediately and continue until a suitable candidate is found. Once a successful applicant has been determined a formal application to the University is required, with a deadline of February 1, 2026. \n\n \n\nCompensation \n\nStudents will receive a funding package of approximately $34,000 per year. This includes a combination of a graduate teaching assistantship, internal fellowships and a research assistantship. Further, during the first 2-3 years of the project, students working fulltime in the field will be provided shared housing.

ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nThe mission of the Tropical Crop and Commodity Protection Research Unit in Hilo, Hawaii is to develop pre and postharvest technologies and management strategies for invasive pests, and to open and maintain market access and improved quality of tropical fruit, vegetable and ornamental crops grown in the Pacific Basin. The long-term goals of our research program are to develop and protect U.S export markets for fresh tropical commodities. An emphasis is placed on expanding and diversifying agriculture and agricultural exports in Hawaii and other states by providing environmentally sound, economically viable systems, treatments, or processes that control quarantine pests, ensure product quality, and increase product value while safeguarding the agriculture of other states.\n\nResearch Project: ‘Ulu (breadfruit) has significant cultural importance to Hawaiians and is one of the original staple crops that fed the island nation for close to 1,000 years with high starch, fiber, and protein contents. ‘Ulu also has a low to moderate glycemic index when cooked and can help manage blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Today, at nearly 2,500 miles from the US mainland, Hawaii imports greater than 85% of its food. Disruption to the supply chain can have catastrophic effects as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2020, food insecurity has dramatically increased among the Islands, encouraging the expansion of stable crops and processing capabilities that support the long-term storage and distribution of processed foods derived from these staple foods.\n\nMuch of Hawaii ‘ulu supply is sold as fresh produce. Mature ‘ulu, once picked, becomes soft within 1-3 days without refrigeration; the short shelf-life reduces profit margins, generates waste, limits its distribution and export opportunities. The ‘Ulu Cooperative, a collection of small, diversified ‘ulu producers, helped develop processes to produce ‘ulu flour in 2011 to increase its potential market and maximize the yield of ‘ulu. One of the biggest hurdles, however, to the processing of many of Hawaii’s crops is the lack of industrial scale facilities. With Hawaii having the highest electricity retail price at more than double the US average, the cost of large-scale processing is prohibitive. Presently, processing of ‘ulu relies on steamers and dehydrators, which are time consuming and do not produce the most consistent quality of end products. Improved processing methods are urgently needed to overcome the bottleneck of scaling up ‘ulu production, increase market distribution, reduce waste, and foster local economies. Specific activities will include maintaining and operating food processing equipment, experimental design, and nutritional and sensory analysis. Outcomes from this project will be useful to our 'ulu growers as well as other tropical commodities that are extremely perishable and in need of better processing methods.\n\nLearning Objectives: The participant will learn how to incorporate their scientific and technical knowledge in the field of food science with food processing engineering to improve the processing capability for both research within ARS and the stakeholders in Hawaii. The participant will get to explore the possibility of incorporating sensors, spectroscopy, imaging, and machine learning techniques into the postharvest processing workflows and/or pre-harvest evaluation of food quality and safety. The participant will have the opportunity to interact with our commercial and academic collaborators, and present their research to a wide range of audiences in engineering and food science disciplines.\n\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Peishih Liang (peishih.liang@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full-time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. \n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS.

With campuses in Vancouver and Kelowna, in the Okanagan, UBC has over 66,000 students, over $700 million in research funding, a sophisticated and deeply engaging intellectual environment and an unrivalled quality of life.\n We recognize the legitimate impact that leaves (e.g., parental leave, leave due to illness) or non-traditional career paths can have on a candidate’s record of research achievement and these leaves will be taken into careful consideration during the assessment process. Equity and diversity are essential to academic excellence. An open and diverse community fosters the inclusion of voices that have been underrepresented or discouraged. We encourage applications from members of groups that have been marginalized on any grounds enumerated under the B.C. Human Rights Code, including sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, racialization, disability, political belief, religion, marital or family status, age, and/or status as a First Nation, Metis, Inuit, or Indigenous person.

Our educational programs explore the human and ecological dimensions of the complex environmental problems faced by our local partners, contributing to sustainable solutions in the places where we live and work. The SFS community is part of a growing network of individuals and institutions committed to environmental stewardship.\n\nLocation:  \n\nSiem Reap, Cambodia     \n\nStart Date:\nJanuary 5th, 2026 \n\nPosition Summary:  \n\nThe SFS Center for Environmental Justice and Mekong Ecologies, located in Siem Reap, Cambodia, seeks an enthusiastic, team-oriented individual to serve as part of a team of faculty and staff that delivers an interdisciplinary, hands-on learning experience to students spending a semester in Cambodia. On a contract basis, the Lecturer in Freshwater Ecology will deliver the 50-hour Freshwater Ecology course during the fall and spring semesters. Additionally, during fall and spring, they will co-teach the 50-hour Directed Research course with other faculty members, leading a faculty-developed directed research project with a small group of students.  \n\nSFS programs are field-based and experiential. This position will engage students in a classroom and through extensive time spent in the field. We encourage faculty to integrate as much fieldwork and hands-on experience into their courses as possible.  \n\nSFS programs do not follow a nine to five model. Faculty are also integral members of the Center’s communal living model, eating and working with the student cohort.   \n\nFaculty are expected to be active members in the community-building process. Additional responsibilities outside of teaching may include participation in community engagement days, involvement in student life, organization of laboratory space, and general Center upkeep. We are especially interested in candidates with experience teaching to a diverse student body, and demonstrated commitment to diversity, inclusion, and cultural competence in a learning environment, conservation, and the Center’s host community.   \n\nCenter Focus: \nThe SFS Center for Environmental Justice and Mekong Ecologies seeks to understand both the conflicts and synergies of conservation and development. Students gain a sense of the richness of the greater Mekong region—biodiversity, social and cultural diversity, and ecosystem services—while exploring strategies for sustainable livelihoods within Cambodia, a highly productive and diverse country in Southeast Asia.  \n\nThe interdisciplinary themes of natural sciences, socio-ecological resilience, environmental ethics and justice, and conservation guide our inquiry. Through coursework, field exercises, and Directed Research, students study people’s dependence on the environment, examine various threats to the environment and to livelihood resilience, and explore the tools and strategies for mitigating the threats and promoting well-being among rural communities. \n\nMinimum Qualifications:\n\nPh.D. and university-level teaching experience in freshwater or aquatic ecology, environmental science, conservation biology, or related fields. Candidates with a Master’s degree and significant scholarship may be considered. \n\nFluency in English (all courses taught in English) \n\nField research experience, preferably in the fields of freshwater ecology, conservation biology, natural resource management, or related fields. \n\nStrong skills in quantitative research methods \n\nExtensive knowledge and experience in statistical analysis \n\nDemonstrated commitment to creating inclusive learning environments \n\nDemonstrated ability to work as part of an interdisciplinary teaching and research team \n\nTrack record of research publications \n\nDemonstrated commitment to environmental issues \n\n\nPreferred Qualifications: \n\nCandidates with pre-existing work authorization for Cambodia and/or are a Cambodian national are preferred     \n\nExperience working in SE Asia, particularly Cambodia\n\nExperience teaching field courses \n\nExperience with residential student group management and/or risk management \n\nFluency or proficiency in Khmer \n\nExperience cross-teaching or collaborating on projects in conservation biology, natural resource management, or interdisciplinary environmental studies with a focus on human–environment interactions \n\nAble to operate standard transmission vehicles (driving license may be required) \n\nTrack record of grant writing success \n\nCurrent First Aid, CPR, and/or Wilderness First Aid certification \n\nCourse Descriptions: \n\nFreshwater Ecology: This course introduces students to the freshwater ecology of Cambodia’s Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake, one of the world’s most interesting flood-pulse ecosystems. Students investigate key ecological processes such as primary productivity, nutrient cycling, food webs, and species interactions in river–lake systems shaped by seasonal hydrology. Hands-on training includes fish morphology and assemblage identification, water quality sampling, species surveys, and biodiversity indices to assess ecosystem health. To complement ecological fieldwork, students conduct interviews and stakeholder analyses to explore how fishing livelihoods, agricultural expansion, and resource use intersect with water quality and ecosystem dynamics. Through this integrated lens, students develop a deeper understanding of the ecological and human dimensions that sustain and challenge Cambodia’s freshwater systems. \n\nDirected Research: This course provides students with the opportunity to apply ecological, biological, and/or social-scientific methods to a field research project that addresses a local issue related to the environment. We will also investigate the ways that various methods and theories distinguish (or don’t) fact from interpretation, cause from correlation, and advocacy from objectivity. The directed research topics are derived from the SFS Center’s Research Plan as defined by the Center staff and local stakeholders. Through the Directed Research project, students will contribute to a growing body of scientific research that informs local conservation and resource management decisions. SFS program lecturers lead a small group of students in this research component of the program.\n\nTo Apply and Learn More, Please Visit: Submit a cover letter and resume outlining relevant experiences via the online application on the SFS Careers page at https://fieldstudies.catsone.com/careers/ \n\nContact\nSFS Human Resources, Nicole Vierthaler\njobs@fieldstudies.org\ncontact via the web posting is preferred (see Details section)",
