This position will take over from one of our outgoing techs and overlap a current tech who will remain through December 2025 and be replaced in January 2026.\n\nEkipa Fanihy carries out capture and sampling of Madagascar’s fruit bats (Pteropus rufus, Eidolon dupreanum, and Rousettus madagascariensis) at roost sites in the District of Moramanga, Madagascar, with possible extensions to field sites elsewhere. This work supports a long-term field study based in the Brook Lab at UC Berkeley, which aims to decipher the mechanisms underpinning persistence of potentially zoonotic RNA viruses in wild, Madagascar fruit bats. Bats are reservoirs for several important, highly-virulent zoonoses, including rabies, Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, and SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses. This work also contributes data to population viability analyses and assessments of the conservation status of threatened fruit bats in Madagascar. Please see the Brook Lab website for further details about the major themes of the project.\n\nField technicians will be trained in the field in September 2025 by project PI, Professor Cara Brook, and one current technician on the job, then supervised remotely (from UC Berkeley) for the duration of the year, interspersed with regular visits from Dr. Brook and other members of the Brook lab.\n\nTechs will spend approximately 70% of their time in the field. During each field mission, techs will travel with University of Antananarivo PhD students for up to 1-2 days to remote field sites in vehicles with hired drivers. While in the field, the team will reside in tents provided by the project for up to two weeks at a time. The work will necessitate strenuous hiking and hauling heavy equipment, sometimes in adverse weather conditions. During field missions, a local cook will be hired to prepare meals, and all expenses (including food) will be funded by the project.\n\nWhile in the field, the field team will capture bats, collect biological samples (blood, urine, feces, saliva, ectoparasites, wing punches), and undertake basic sample preparation (i.e. centrifugation) and storage in liquid nitrogen. The work will be unevenly paced with periods of intense work interspersed with significant downtime; techs will need to be prepared to entertain themselves during this downtime with reading, writing, personal research projects, studying Malagasy, etc. Many field missions will overlap traditional weekends, and techs will be expected to work during these periods.\n\nIn between field missions (30% of the time), techs will live in a shared house in Madagascar’s capital city of Antananarivo (housing includes a modern kitchen, ample living space, modern bathroom, WiFi, on-site security, and monthly cleaning services). Each tech will be provided a private bedroom. In Antananarivo (‘Tana’), the techs will work with Ekipa Fanihy to further treat, organize, and conduct basic molecular analyses (DNA/RNA extractions, PCR, etc.) of samples at our laboratory at Madagascar Biodiversity Center. Together, the two field techs will be additionally responsible for restocking, packing, and preparation of field supplies for recurring field missions. When weekends overlap with periods of time in the city, techs will have free time to travel locally, take Malagasy lessons, and reset as needed.\n\nWhen not in the field, techs will additionally have opportunities to take part in professional development in the form of remote lab meetings with the Brook Lab at UC Berkeley, as well as receive guidance on the graduate school application process if desired. Field technicians will be acknowledged on publications arising from this work and may or may not be included as co-authors depending on the duration of their employment and the extent of their intellectual contributions to data analysis and interpretation after the field work concludes. Opportunities for independent work–either in science communication or in research–may be pursued on a case-by-case basis.\n\nPlease visit the Brook Lab News page to read prior field technician Katherine McFerrin’s blog post, summarizing “A Day in the Life of a Field Project Manager” to read what life is like for our team in the field. Feel free to reach out to contact current and former Ekipa Fanihy field technicians, Monique Ades (at mnades06@gmail.com) or Martin Roland (at martincroland@gmail.com), with any questions about the job.\n\nContact\nCara Brook\ncbrook@berkeley.edu (preferred contact method)",

This work will primarily involve conducting large-scale data synthesis projects to better understand the drivers of urban metacommunities and biodiversity patterns. In particular, the lab is interested in understanding the drivers of biotic heterogeneity in urban environments and the spatial/temporal dynamics of these drivers. This will involve working with pre-existing data collected by the lab, as well as collaborator data and publicly available data from an array of cities. As such, the postdoc should have strong experience working with large datasets, modeling ecological data, and maintaining national/international collaborations. The postdoc will have a relatively high degree of autonomy in developing research projects and directions, in concert with Aaron Sexton, lab PI. If interested, the postdoc could also join in data collection in ongoing field research projects, but this will not encompass a majority of the researcher’s time.
