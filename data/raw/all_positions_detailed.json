Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: This project will evaluate smoke emissions over a broad range of fuel, fuel moisture, and meteorological conditions and prescribed, cultural, and wildfire burn events. Using available software platforms, smoke emission factors and total smoke production by factor will be accounted for and differenced for the range of burn conditions as above. This research will involve a collaborative process with Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forests and create geospatial tools for wildfire, prescribed burning, and cultural burning related smoke trade-off analyses and quantitative forest landscape restoration and decision support. Results and findings will be submitted to one or more leading peer-reviewed journals, and presentations will be provided to Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest and other partners, along with the databases we create. The geospatial smoke tradeoffs dataset can then be used in project planning.\n\nLearning Objectives: The fellow will develop professionally while engaging in research-operational partnerships and learning about systems involving forest fuels and fire emissions modeling. They will gain experience with modeling, coding, and database management in support of a complex, multi-model ecological forecasting workflow.

The GLOBE research group, led by Vojtěch Kubelka from Department of Zoology and Centre for Polar Ecology at the Faculty of Sciences, University of South Bohemia in the Czech republic, has been recently awarded a prestigious ERC CZ grant: Animal migrations in a changing world – still advantageous strategy or maladaptive behaviour? for five years till 2029.\n\n\nAnimal migrations represent one of the greatest spectacles in nature, providing crucial ecosystem services as well as resources for human communities. Why do animals migrate? It has been thought that animals migrate to reproduce at higher latitudes, taking advantage of lower predation pressure, fewer parasites and seasonally high pulses in food supply. However, it has been highlighted that recent climate change and human pressure impacts can erode such benefits and migratory animals are declining globally with poorly understood underlying mechanisms.\n\n\nWe strive to tackle pressing issues: Are there still latitudinal gradients in predation, parasitism and seasonal food availability, supporting the benefits of migratory behaviour? How are migratory animals able to cope with environmental changes? What are the most important drivers and life stages limiting populations of migratory animals? To achieve this, we are executing comprehensive research of migration profitability, combining experimental, observational and comparative approaches – investigating latitudinal gradients in predation, parasites, food supply and whole life-cycles of tracked shorebirds, a suitable model taxon with intra-specific variability in migratory strategies and exposed ground nests – at 16 study sites from the Arctic to Patagonia.\n\n\nWe seek to appoint an early career scientist as post-doctoral researcher to contribute to this new project.\n\n\nWhat would be your main responsibilities\n\nOrganize and conduct ornithological field work at selected study sites across Western Palearctic and South America in association with international collaborators\nCombine experimental and observational fieldwork with a comparative approach based on extracting relevant information from published literature\nCoordinate data collection and analyses, working with large datasets in relational databases\nPrepare and write manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals\nLead or participate in funding applications for research in collaboration with team members\nSupervise students and research assistants\nParticipate in conservation activities\nPresent and promote the results at conferences and seminars\nDisseminate the project outputs to stakeholders and public,\nCarry out other scientific and/or academic activities that are important for the success of the project\n\nWhat we offer\n\nA two-year position with the possibility of extension based on the performance\nExcellent instruments, equipment and multiple research platforms within the Faculty of Sciences, University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice, Czech Republic\nAccess to the Czech Arctic research station at Svalbard and fieldwork at study sites along latitudinal gradients from Morocco to Arctic and from tropical South America to Patagonia\nExtensive international networking and mentoring opportunities\nFull logistical support for own follow-up research funding applications\nEnglish speaking, stimulating & friendly international research environment\nHR Award certificate, jcu.cz/about-the-university/development/hr-award-hrs4r\nProfessional administration support and assistance with all personal, economic, legal, project, IT, intellectual property needs, flexible working time\nCompetitive salary + possible bonuses, 5 weeks of paid vacation per year\nMeals allowance, special mobile services, university kindergarten\nWork-life balance in a historical middle-sized university city, cz/en/\n\nCompetitive candidates are expected to have\n\nPhD in evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology, zoology, or relevant field of life sciences\nA foundation of knowledge in two or more fields: evolutionary ecology, climate change biology, demography and population dynamics, predator-prey interactions and animal migration\nExperience in conducting or supervising international research projects\n3+ years hands-on experience in field research, with preference for experience with fieldwork in tropical or Arctic locations\nOrnithological fieldwork experience including bird handling and ringing (bird ringing licence is welcomed but not necessary)\nGood skills in statistical modelling, advanced level in using R\nStrong record of success conducting research and scholarly activities, including publications in peer-reviewed journals\nExperience working with analysis and presentation of large data sets\nDemonstrated project management experience and leadership skills\nBudgetary and general administrative skills\nExcellent interpersonal skills and ability to collaborate within a team-based environment, ability to work effectively both in a team and independently\nValid driving licence\n\n\nLocation description \n\nCeske Budejovice is a vibrant medium-sized city and centre of South Bohemian region with an international university community.

Its primary purpose is to serve the original needs of the NGO’s operations which are wildlife conservation through research and education. This is accomplished through the layout of the farm which provides extensive wildlife habitat and foraging opportunities, increasing the local faunal biodiversity as well as acting as an educational demonstration to local subsistence farmers and visiting students.  \nInterns will learn by assisting in implementation and evaluation of management practices, cropping, and record keeping on the farm with this vision in mind while we endeavor to maximize the products coming from the farm with the existing design and layout using sustainable and regenerative practices specific to the Mesoamerican uplands. Within this broad framework, intern projects can include several basic Agricultural Education disciplines including Tropical Agriculture, Sustainable/organic Agriculture, Farm Management, Waste management, and Agricultural Economics.  \nIn addition to planting crops, we also have free range chickens and ducks for eggs and meat. We are looking to increase our revenue generation from the farm either in the form of increased accountable products entering our kitchen for use in our restaurant, or for sale to the Mobile Market or in a proposed road-side café which would be managed by T.R.E.E.S kitchen and hospitality staff. Thus, interns would also assist us with marketing strategy for existing products and/or planting. \nBy the successful conclusion of this internship, the student will be able to apply practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species, basic free range poultry operations, evaluate different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns, and become familiar with sustainable management practices such as no/low till, cover cropping, waste management, mulching, marketing, Farm-to-Table, etc. \n Requirements: \nNo prior tropical agriculture experience required. Interns can be current undergraduate or graduate students enrolled in a program with their University/College for credit however non-students can also apply; but preference will be given to students enrolled in an accreditation program. Experienced tropical agriculturalists and/or agroforestry professionals are also welcome and will be treated according to their experience level and are eligible for *discounted rates. \n Internship Responsibilities: \nApplying practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species and basic free range poultry operations. \nEvaluating different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns. \nWork on Inga Alley-cropping and other regenerative cropping practices, and using intercropping, organic fertilizing and pest control practices. \nAssist with innovative marketing strategies for existing products accompanied by reviewing projected budgets for the farm and their products and exploring cost/profit ratios for poultry husbandry. \nPlanting and selling new products for the farm. \nOpportunities are also available to observe and participate with concurrent intern and wildlife educational activities such as mist-netting, observing and recording measurements of bats, birds, herps, invertebrates, water quality, and much more. \nInterns will assist with creating captions for social media posts to engage and update followers on what has been going on at the field station and various projects that are being done. \n Internship Period: \nInterns can choose to do a minimum of 2 weeks to a maximum of 5 weeks during this Apprenticeship program, though 4 weeks is the recommended duration. \n Costs: \nThis internship has a fee of $184 USD/week which includes room and board (meals included Monday-Friday), full access to lab equipment, and training by professional on-site biologists. Food is not provided as part of the internship program. Interns can also purchase their own basic food supplies from nearby vendors that can be prepared simply on-site without access to a full kitchen OR interns can order meals from the on-site Toucan Café restaurant that is open daily and caters to all dietary restrictions Lodging at the research center signifies a shared dormitory-style rustic cabins with other same sex interns with full access to other facilities such as showers, restrooms, and kitchen. The nature of this program allows interns to carry out most of the work independently after the training period is done. Fees do not include airport transfer, flights, travel medical insurance, or $100 USD visitor permit fee if remaining in country for more than 30 days.    \nWe are hoping to expand our internship program beyond North America. Citizens from Latin America and the Caribbean will be charged at a discounted rate of 50%. Belizeans will get another discount.
