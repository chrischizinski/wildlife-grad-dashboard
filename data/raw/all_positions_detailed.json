Red Shiner are a persistent and ecologically detrimental invasive species, negatively impacting aquatic ecosystems throughout the West. Control of invasive Red Shiner populations is widely ineffective utilizing existing management tools. Therefore, alternative management strategies are necessary, such as skewing invasive population sex ratios towards all males through YY fish releases. The aim of this project is to determine the efficacy of YY Red Shiner releases by incorporating dispersal capabilities and population structure into management-ready models. \n Position Duties: The goals of this project are to: \n\n1.      Conduct mark-recapture methods and population structure admixture analysis to estimate dispersal potential and interconnectivity of the Verde River, AZ and Virgin  \n          River, NV Red Shiner populations, respectively. \n2.      Develop YY release simulations to assess the feasibility of eradicating invasive Red Shiner populations \n\nThis position will entail extensive field work and coordination with multiple state and federal biologists to sample the Verde River, AZ and Virgin River, NV. The student will deploy PIT tag arrays, conduct Red Shiner population estimates, and collect DNA samples in remote and inhospitable field locations. The student will lead a population admixture analysis utilizing DNA samples. Ultimately, the student will incorporate their data into simulations of YY Red Shiner releases to inform management on the scale of effectiveness for YY Red Shiner release scenarios. The student will author manuscripts and present at conferences to disseminate findings. The student will develop highly applicable skills for future careers in fisheries, genetics, ecology, and natural resource management, and will obtain mentoring experience by supervising undergraduate research technicians. The partners and sponsors for this project are an excellent team of scientists from federal and state agencies. The selected student will be advised by Dr. Chad Teal (U.S. Geological Survey, Utah State University) in the Technical and Experimental Aquatics Lab. In addition to these research duties, the student will need to successfully complete the required coursework, author and defend a dissertation, and graduate with their PhD within 5 years of starting. \n\nQualifications: M.S. in fisheries, ecology, quantitative methods, natural resource management, or other related fields with a minimum 3.2 GPA. A good work ethic is mandatory. Experience in leading field work is preferred. Writing, organizational, data management skills, and quantitative skills are required, as well as the ability to maintain positive working relationships with members of the lab, department, and stakeholder groups. Only applicants that can obtain a valid U.S. driver’s license by start date need apply.

Green Sunfish is one of the fastest expanding invaders in the Southwest and are among the most invasive fish species due to their negative impacts on native fish communities. Management of invasive Green Sunfish populations requires highly intensive efforts and traditional removal techniques are seldomly effective. Therefore, alternative management strategies are necessary, such as skewing invasive population sex ratios towards all males through YY fish releases. This project will assess the feasibility of producing YY Green Sunfish by: \n\n1)     Investigating Green Sunfish genomes to uncover the sex determination system of this species and develop effective genetic sex ID markers. \n2)     Examining the effects of various environmental factors on the sex ratios of laboratory-reared Green Sunfish cohorts. \n\nPosition Duties: This position entails field work (collecting broodstock and DNA from invasive populations), hatchery management (conducting heat and rearing density experiments), and lab work (DNA extractions, bioinformatic analyses, and sex ID marker development). The student will author manuscripts and present at conferences to disseminate findings. The student will develop highly applicable skills for future careers in fisheries, genetics, aquaculture, and natural resource management, and will obtain mentoring experience by supervising undergraduate research technicians. The partners and sponsors for this project are an excellent team of scientists from federal and state agencies. The selected student will be advised by Dr. Chad Teal (U.S. Geological Survey, Utah State University) in the Technical and Experimental Aquatics Lab. In addition to these research duties, the student will need to successfully complete the required coursework, author and defend a thesis, and graduate with their M.S. within 2.5 years of starting. \n\nQualifications: Bachelor of Science in genetics, aquaculture, fisheries, ecology, natural resource management, or other related fields with a minimum 3.0 GPA (last 60 credits). A good work ethic is mandatory. Preference will be given to candidates that have research experience. Experience working in a variety of settings is preferred. Writing, organizational, data management skills, and quantitative skills are required, as well as the ability to maintain positive working relationships with members of the lab, department, and stakeholder groups. Only applicants that can obtain a valid U.S. driver’s license by start date need apply. Utah State University does not discriminate or tolerate discrimination, including harassment, based on race, religion, sex, national origin, age, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, status as a protected veteran, or any other status protected by University policy, Title IX, or any other federal, state, or local law \n\nLocation: The successful applicant will be based out of the Department of Wildland Resources at Utah State University in Logan, UT. For additional information describing the department, faculty, and programs see https://qanr.usu.edu/. Chad Teal’s faculty page can be found at https://qanr.usu.edu/directory/teal-chad. \n\nSalary and Benefits: Starting annual stipend of $27,000; plus tuition, fees, and health insurance will be covered. \n\nApplication Deadline: March 11, 2026. \n\nPosition Start Date: August 24, 2026. \n\nHow to Apply: Please email a cover letter, resume or CV, a writing sample, unofficial copies of transcripts, and three professional/academic letters of recommendation to Dr. Chad Teal, email: chad.teal@usu.edu \nContact\nChad Teal\nchad.teal@usu.edu (preferred contact method)",

The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: The US National Poultry Research Center (USNPRC) is seeking a postdoctoral fellow to investigate the complex molecular interactions between Infectious Laryngotracheitis Virus (ILTV) and the host immune system. As an alphaherpesvirus, ILTV causes significant economic losses worldwide through respiratory distress and decreased production in poultry. This research specifically focuses on the characterization of virus-encoded immunoregulatory proteins, known as virokines, which serve as evolved mechanisms allowing the virus to subvert or evade the host’s innate and adaptive immune responses. By utilizing synthetic biology and reverse genetics, the participant will dissect the function of these proteins to identify targets for attenuation, ultimately leveraging these insights to engineer next-generation vaccine candidates using viral-vector platforms to bridge the gap between fundamental virology and applied veterinary medicine.\n\nResearch activities will include the characterization of novel ILTV-encoded virokines to determine their specific cellular targets within the avian immune system and develop novel vaccines. The fellow will determine the role of these immunomodulatory proteins in viral replication and pathogenesis using both in vitro and in vivo models.

Its primary purpose is to serve the original needs of the NGO’s operations which are wildlife conservation through research and education. This is accomplished through the layout of the farm which provides extensive wildlife habitat and foraging opportunities, increasing the local faunal biodiversity as well as acting as an educational demonstration to local subsistence farmers and visiting students.  \n  Interns will learn by assisting in implementation and evaluation of management practices, cropping, and record keeping on the farm with this vision in mind while we endeavor to maximize the products coming from the farm with the existing design and layout using sustainable and regenerative practices specific to the Mesoamerican uplands. Within this broad framework, intern projects can include several basic Agricultural Education disciplines including Tropical Agriculture, Sustainable/organic Agriculture, Farm Management, Waste management, and Agricultural Economics.  \n  In addition to planting crops, we also have free range chickens and ducks for eggs and meat. We are looking to increase our revenue generation from the farm either in the form of increased accountable products entering our kitchen for use in our restaurant, or for sale to the Mobile Market or in a proposed road-side café which would be managed by T.R.E.E.S kitchen and hospitality staff. Thus, interns would also assist us with our marketing strategy for existing products and/or planting. \n  By the successful conclusion of this internship, the student will be able to apply practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species, basic free range poultry operations, evaluate different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns, and become familiar with sustainable management practices such as no/low till, cover cropping, waste management, mulching, marketing, Farm-to-Table, etc. \n    Requirements: \n No prior tropical agriculture experience required. Interns can be current undergraduate or graduate students enrolled in a program with their University/College for credit, however non-students can also apply; but preference will be given to students enrolled in an accreditation program. Experienced tropical agriculturalists and/or agroforestry professionals are also welcome and will be treated according to their experience level and are eligible for *discounted rates. \n    Internship Responsibilities: \n Applying practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species and basic free range poultry operations. \nEvaluating different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns. \nWork on Inga Alley-cropping and other regenerative cropping practices, and using intercropping, organic fertilizing and pest control practices. \nAssist with innovative marketing strategies for existing products accompanied by reviewing projected budgets for the farm and their products and exploring cost/profit ratios for poultry husbandry. \nPlanting and selling new products for the farm. \nOpportunities are also available to observe and participate with concurrent intern and wildlife educational activities such as mist-netting, observing and recording measurements of bats, birds, herps, invertebrates, water quality, and much more. \nInterns will assist with creating captions for social media posts to engage and update followers on what has been going on at the field station and various projects that are being done. \n     Costs: \n The internship fee includes room and board (meals included Monday-Friday), full access to lab equipment, and training by professional on-site biologists. Food is a combination of self-catering in a communal kitchen with ingredients provided as well as prepared meals, depending on whether we have other groups on site. Lodging at the research center signifies a shared dormitory-style rustic cabins with other same sex interns. This comes with full access to other facilities such as showers, restrooms, and kitchen. The nature of this program allows interns to carry out most of the work independently after the training period is done. Fees do not include airport transfer, flights, travel medical insurance, or $100 USD visitor permit fee if remaining in country for more than 30 days.    \n  We are hoping to expand our internship program beyond North America. Citizens from Latin America and the Caribbean will be charged at a discounted rate of 50%. Belizeans will get another discount. For more information, kindly email Scandia Cruz with the email provided above. \n    Schedule: \n Interns are required to work for 35 hours/week minimum. The typical schedule runs from Monday through Friday, from 6:30 am until 12:30 pm and 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm. Weekends are free time for interns; therefore, you can do as please (travel, hike, relax). No refunds on food and lodging will be available if the intern decides to leave the station. Projects may sometimes run into the weekend; in which case the days will be returned to them during the week. The intern supervisor(s) will be responsible for designing a schedule with the intern each week that is reasonable and includes work on the various projects. \n  Application:  \n For more information on our organization and facilities please visit our website: www.treesociety.org.
