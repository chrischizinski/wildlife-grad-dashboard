ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nThe mission of our research is to improve food safety and reduce foodborne illness by examining routes of contamination of fruits and vegetables with bacterial pathogens.\n\nResearch Project: The participant will examine issues related to irrigation water quality and sustainability. Specifically, the fellow will research to examine specific pre-harvest environments that support bacterial pathogen (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica) survival under a variety of conditions that are not optimal growth conditions. The survival data of pathogens under these conditions (growth matrices + sub-optimal growth temperatures + antimicrobial stresses) will also be used to assess transfer of pathogen loads to fruits and vegetables. The microbial community changes and its influence on pathogen levels will also be quantified. These data will fit into models that could predict the likelihood of contamination with certain environmental conditions. \n\nUnder guidance of the mentor the participant will design and be a part off all aspects of the experiment, from laboratory to growth chambers to fields, in consultation with ARS and academic collaborators. This growth and survival assays, combinations of growth / survival conditions, methodology and protocols, along with digital PCR, multiplex PCR, and microbial community analysis required. Participant will also learn about statistical analysis of data in consultation with ARS colleagues. Participant will be a part of field studies and cultivation and growth of plants/ fruits, and filter construction and maintenance as related to the research project. Participant will learn about scientific and laboratory setup and organization of these studies. \n\nLearning Objectives: The participant will learn methods to quantify and / or determine the prevalence of bacterial pathogen loads in irrigation water, novel filter design concepts, integrated data collection and analysis methods. The participant will have the opportunity to learn more in-depth statistical analysis techniques or molecular biology tools (bioinformatics) through various trainings and workshops if desired, and also through collaboration on interdisciplinary project within ARS. This is an integrated produce safety research project, and the participant will have opportunities to learn at each stage of the continuum. Digital PCR techniques, along with automated nucleic acid extraction techniques, microbial community and analysis and introductory data science skills will be required for the project\n\nThe participant can expect to present data / findings at international scientific meetings related to food safety / environmental microbiology, and regional (U.S. Mid-Atlantic region) meetings as well. USDA ARS EMFSL is located in the metro-Washington, D.C. area at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC), which provides ample interaction with ARS scientists as well as with other government research scientists and policymakers at regulatory agencies in private industry. EMFSL has a strong history of collaborating with many different academic institutions, U.S. federal government agencies on large field- and laboratory-based research, and private industry and stakeholder research projects. ORISE fellows, post-doctoral research associates and interns who have previously been at EMFSL have had success in using their experience to gain different opportunities at the state and federal government levels, and with trade associations and in private industry. \n\nThere are three learning objectives for the participant.\n\nCharacterize bacterial pathogens levels in the produce pre-harvest environment and follow their levels and ability to transfer to fruits and vegetables.\nModel bacterial pathogenic levels through complex survival and growth patterns.\nUtilize either data analysis or molecular analysis tools (or both) to inform strategies to optimize pre-harvest guidelines for farmers that can reduce pathogenic bacterial levels on fruits and vegetables. \nMentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Manan Sharma (manan.sharma@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: 2025. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $6,277 - $6,897 monthly.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS.

The students will use Autonomous Recording Units (ARUs) and spring drumming counts to determine occupancy and abundance of Ruffed Grouse. The students will also be responsible for sampling mosquitoes for West Nile Virus. Finally, the students will collect data about other breeding birds utilizing young forests, and vegetation structure data.\n\nThis project will occur across West Virginia on private and public lands. Ruffed Grouse and bird utilizing young forests have declined precipitously, and the goal of this project is to identify landscape scale management strategies to improve populations via occupancy or abundance. Additionally, West Nile Virus could be a contributing factor in Ruffed Grouse declines, and in West Virginia there are no data about the distribution and prevalence of the virus or mosquitoes. The students will also have opportunities and flexibility to develop and design additional research projects if they are within the scope of the main project questions. Some songbird species that could respond to management include Golden-winged warbler, Prairie warbler, and Yellow-breasted chat. \n\nThe project will occur on multiple state wildlife management areas, state forests, and on Weyerhaeuser property. There will be significant traveling and potential for camping or living in rustic state field houses. The students should also have experience driving on gravel or dirt roads and with 4x4 vehicles. The data collection will begin in April and continue into August. Students should expect to be flexible with scheduling and work together to coordinate data collection schedules. Results should inform landscape level planning and management strategies for Ruffed Grouse and other young forest species. The research is funded through the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources, Ruffed Grouse Society, and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. \n\nThe students will be working towards a Ph.D. and master’s in Wildlife and Fisheries Resources at West Virginia University. STARTING DATE: January 2026. The ideal applicant should have experience with ARUs and analyzing acoustic data, must be able to identify central Appalachian avian species by sight and by sound and have experience conducting point count surveys, and some experience with insect sampling and mosquito identification. Applicants should also be familiar with collecting structural habitat measurements including but not limited to; DBH, canopy cover (using spherical densitometers), Robel pole, Daubenmire frame, etc. Applicants should be comfortable working long days in the field during hot summer months, ready to travel, and energetic and excited about applied avian conservation research. Applicants will also be responsible for hiring and supervising research technicians to assist with research duties.

The position will preferably begin in January of 2026, but alternative start dates may be possible. \n\nProject Description: \nThe project will study patterns of occupancy and abundance of Kirtland’s Warbler, Common Nighthawk, Eastern Whip-poor-will, Spruce Grouse, and Ruffed Grouse on sites managed for the warbler. To determine how occupancy and abundance vary with site- and landscape-level factors, we will integrate acoustic data collected via autonomous recording units and vegetation surveys from across the Kirtland’s Warbler breeding range with remote sensing data to build models that predict habitat characteristics that optimize abundance across species. Our research will produce recommendations on how best to manage and create habitat within Kirtland’s Warbler Management Areas and will also highlight where to prioritize restoration projects - all with the goal of creating optimal Kirtland’s Warbler habitat while maximizing avian species richness and recreation (i.e., hunting) opportunity. \nThe Ph.D. student will be supported on a combination of Graduate Research Assistantships and Graduate Teaching Assistantships for the duration of the degree (5 years). The position includes a tuition waiver and monthly stipend (currently $2,848/month). Travel during fieldwork and other associated research costs will also be funded. \n Required Qualifications: \nCandidates for this position must possess a minimum of a Bachelor of Science degree (Master of Science strongly preferred) in Wildlife, Biology, Zoology, or a related field. Furthermore, they must have an academic transcript commensurate with acceptance to the graduate program in Fisheries and Wildlife in the School of Environment and Natural Resources (https://senr.osu.edu/graduate/admissions). \nThis project will generate a large amount of data for analysis, thus in addition to prior field work experience, we are seeking a student with excellent quantitative skills and experience with GIS. Therefore, the successful candidate will have experience working with Program R, ArcGIS or other GIS software, multiple years of experience in field ecology, the ability and willingness to work long hours independently in the field, and a valid drivers license. \n Preferred Qualifications: \nAdditional desirable qualifications include experience in programming languages in addition to R , experience working with autonomous recording units (ARUs) and associated data, experience conducting vegetation surveys, and bird identification skills. \n  To apply: \nEmail a 1-page cover letter outlining your interest in and qualifications for the position, C.V., unofficial academic transcript, and contact information for 3 references to Chris Tonra (tonra.1@osu.edu).

Help advance science about tropical montane forest bird communities. Learn how to collect data to determine community and species-level responses to deforestation, forest recovery, forest fragmentation, and landscape and climate changes. Your participation helps sustain an important protected area in the mega-diverse Choco Endemic Bird Area (EBA). \n\nCost-share volunteers/trainees assist Dr. Dusti Becker with long-term avian monitoring and conservation in the Andes at the beautiful forest protected area, Reserva las Tangaras.  In exchange volunteers receive experience-based training in mist netting and bird banding, including the use of Hall traps and practice with hummingbird banding. \n\nTeam Dates:      August 9-22, 2026 (8 positions available)\n\n                             December 7-20, 2026 (8 positions available)\n\nWhere:  Reserva Las Tangaras, a 130-acre nature preserve, boasts more than 25 species of hummingbirds, dozens of colorful tanagers, the largest regional Andean cock-of-the-rock display lek, along with over 300 tropical bird species, many of which are Choco and Andean endemics. During the expedition, LNN teams typically detect around 175 - 200 different species of birds in the reserve and study area. Team members always see additional bird species while traveling to and from the project site. The reserve is also home to endangered capuchin monkeys, spectacled bears, cougars, and myriads of other wildlife species, including several rare and endangered rain frogs. \n\nActivities: Volunteers are trained (or refreshed on) setting up and monitoring mist nets, extracting birds from nets, carrying birds from nets to banding stations, and recording ornithological and ecological data in the field. Volunteers are also trained to band birds and make standard measurements of birds. Volunteers also learn about Hall trapping and banding hummingbirds. The site is rugged, requiring above average fitness including: ability to hike on steep, potentially muddy and slippery terrain, and cover 2-4 miles on foot per day. Back or joint impairments, or obesity may make the project too challenging for some. \n\nVolunteers will have time to explore the Mindo area, and the team visits higher-elevation Bellavista Cloud Forest Reserve on the last day before returning to Quito. The December team will participate in the Mindo Christmas Bird Count (CBC), which typically wins first or second place globally for bird species counted. \n\nFood and Lodging: Accommodation is in a spacious research cabin, where each participant has a single bed mattress with mosquito netting, pillow, and fitted sheet. Two showers with hot water and flush toilets provide comfortable field accommodations. Meals are delicious, home-style Ecuadorian, prepared by excellent cooks, and vegetarian diets can be accommodated. \n\nCOST: Your contribution of $2250 covers transportation during the field project to and from Quito,Ecuador, meals at RLT, lodging at RLT, reserve entrance fees, salaries for Ecuadorian cooks and para-biologists, leader's costs, and a special lunch at the Bellavista Reserve. Airfare to and from Quito, Ecuador and expenses in Quito before and after the expedition are not included. Meals away from RLT during project are not included. \n\nYour cost-share helps sustain Reserva las Tangaras, supporting year-round stewardship, educational programs, outreach materials about cloud forest wildlife, maintenance of trails and signs, cabin repairs, and feeding of resident hummingbirds. Cost-share donations are used to operate the 2-week field expedition: providing the team with food, shelter, training and transportation, as well as purchasing new project equipment and supplies. \n\nThis exciting conservation expedition begins and ends in Quito, Ecuador. \n\nContact Dr. Dusti Becker, dustizuni@yahoo.com, for further details and to obtain a Life Net Nature volunteer application form. \n\nQualifications: Experience with banding and mist-netting are desirable, but not required. We provide training. Students and recent graduates will benefit from this great resume building experience. Professionals and retirees in field biology, will enjoy the \"field camp\" experience and are much appreciated for their co-mentoring and experiences they share. All participants have the option of using the > 20 year project database for research publications, undergraduate projects, or graduate degrees.  \n\nVisit https://lastangaras.wordpress.com/who-are-we/ for more details about Life Net Nature and Reserva Las Tangaras.  \n\nTo apply: Email Dr. Dusti Becker a brief cover e-mail detailing your experience and interest in participating on a given team.

Our precious Southeastern grasslands are nearly extinct, and the species that depend on them are fading fast. Many of our Southeastern grasslands that managed to persist through the past 200 years have disappeared in the past quarter-century. What will the next 25 years bring? As a conservation community, we are only now beginning to realize the extent of our once widespread grasslands. To reverse the decline in grassland biodiversity, our response must be rapid and unprecedented in magnitude. This immensely complex and ambitious challenge will require some of America's brightest and most creative minds in conservation and philanthropy to solve.

    "description": "“I AM BEAR SAFE” PROJECT COORDINATOR Yellowstone-Tetons Country\nWildlife Restoration Foundation (Private) | https://www.wildlifeandparks.org/\nDetails\nPosting:\nhttps://www.wildlifeandparks.org/\nApplication Deadline:\n10/31/2025\nPublished:\n08/25/2025\nStarting Date:\nafter 8/25/2025\nHours per Week:\n16 - 20\nSalary:\nCommensurate / Negotiable\nEducation Required:\nBachelors\nExperience Required:\nat least 2 years\nLocation:\nremote work allowed\nDescription\n The Wildlife Restoration Foundation (WRF) “I Am Bear Safe” (IABS) Project Coordinator for Yellowstone-Tetons Country is open to qualified individuals passionate about bears and based in/near the five countries that neighbor the east and west sides of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks in Wyoming and Idaho. The position is initially unpaid, but stipends are available to cover pre-approved expenses and to reward accomplishments after a productive first month. The Yellowstone-Tetons Country IABS Project Coordinator will rapidly gain valuable professional experience and connections by playing an exciting, integral leadership role on the WRF team. Work to build WRF’s bear conservation capacity and impact on Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Park bears as you contribute and strengthen your conservation knowledge and skills. Gain recognition for your efforts among area partners, on the WRF website and elsewhere, as you participate visibly in meeting WRF’s mission, which is to increase park wildlife population viability both ex situ and in situ, working closely with National Parks and Forests, state wildlife and tourism agencies, Tribes, zoo partners, and park gateway communities. \n\n \n\nWRF operates effectively and efficiently and generates resources that enable measurable, boots-on-the-ground conservation results. Under the direction and guidance of the WRF President and Beary Program Director, the WRF IABS Project Coordinator for Yellowstone-Tetons Country (YTC) will focus on IABS Project implementation in towns like Dubois and Lander, Wyoming and Driggs, Victor and Island Park, Idaho that are park gateway communities frequented by bears. The YTC IABS Project Coordinator will collaborate with the WRF President, Beary Program Director, other IABS Project Coordinators, Director of Communications, and other team members, as well as partnering parks, state agencies, chambers of commerce, tourism entities, and possibly Tribal and zoo partners in connection to the “I Am Bear Safe” Project. [https://www.wildlifeandparks.org/projects]. \n\n \n\n“I Am Bear Safe”™ (IABS) is a multi-partner WRF Collaborating with Wildlife Strategy designed to equip National Park gateway community chambers of commerce and their member businesses (“Park Gateway Partners”), to “train people not to train bears” to get in the trouble they are in now because of human behavior—a situation that is assuring bear demise. Bears are a top attraction at many National Parks and are well-managed within the parks to avoid human interaction. But communities at the park’s edge are not often sufficiently prepared or equipped for the increasing pressure of more visitors coupled with rapid development, naïve new residents, and a growing number of recreationists in bear country. Park Gateway Partner (PGP) businesses are the perfect intervention point and receive marketing benefits from participating in the IABS town-based bear stewardship effort. WRF provides customized tools (signage and SWAG) that equip PGPs to effectively intercept park visitors and recreationists and equip them to be bear stewards who act responsibly by securing attractants and following park and Tribal rules for recreating in bear habitat. The IABS goal is that bears perform their natural behaviors and survive without risk and distraction caused by humans while supporting the economic benefits to park gateway towns from responsible tourism and recreation.\n\n\n\nResponsibilities:\n\n·         Manage the IABS Project on the ground in the small towns that are gateways to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks and neighboring National Forests on the northwest side of the park.\n\n·         Develop, implement, and regularly assess and re-strategize with the team on a plan of action that assures the maximum participation by IABS Park Gateway Partner businesses.\n\n·         Maximize WRF’s opportunities as a member of the town chambers of commerce.\n\n·         Work with the Beary Program Director to manage the IABS Toolkit (signage) inventory of items needed by and distributed to PGPs in each town.\n\n·         Distribute IABS Toolkt materials to PGPs and redistribution points.\n\n·         Recruit new PGPs, setting goals for the season.\n\n·         Field questions and relay PGP concerns to WRF.\n\n·         Attend meetings of the chamber of commerce or local partner organization and events on occasion.\n\n·         Keep the IABS Project Management Database up to date for Yellowstone-Teton Country towns\n\n·         Use creative ways to stimulate Bear Quiz-takers.\n\n·         Come up with novel ideas to make the IABS Project more effective.\n\n·         Possibly coordinate one or more IABS Bear Conservation Specialists/volunteer PGP recruiters.\n\n \n\nEducation & Experience\n Bachelor’s degree in relevant subject is required; graduate degree ideal.\nKnowledge and experience specific to grizzly and black bears required.\nLocation in Montana, Wyoming or Idaho preferred.\nBackground working with federal and state agencies and chambers helpful.\nExperience working with community-based organizations and/or local businesses required. \nOutgoing nature and proven to be self-motivated and organized.\n\n \n\nThe YCT IABS Project Coordinator will be asked to participate in an initial (virtual) training then designate 16 hours a week to WRF and agree to work with WRF for 4 months.
