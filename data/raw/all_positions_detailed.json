The historian at JODA will engage in researching and writing a comprehensive history of how JODA has been managed from 1996 to the present day, including important issues in planning, land acquisition, development, public relations, and other topics of ongoing management concern. The final narrative reference will consist of a scholarly examination of the administrative history of the unit and will serve as a valuable tool for future park managers and scholars. The research effort resulting from this project will significantly expand the site’s reference and archival files and provide additional information for park staff. Finally, the administrative history will be placed on JODA’s website to make the information widely available to the public.\nA chronology of land acquisitions, paleontology research, archaeology surveys, park developments, special programs, resource protection and mitigation, and personnel changes are necessary to conduct many aspects of everyday park operations as well as in preparation for the Park’s 50-year anniversary in 2025. There has been a high degree of turnover at the Park recently. As such, there has been a great deal of loss of institutional memory. Having a new administrative history will help capture institutional knowledge and prevent further loss. The historian will create a published scholarly, and comprehensively updated report bridging the gap between the last administrative history report, in 1996, and the present. This report will be a substantial aid in the documentation of the history of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.\nDescription:\nThe updated administrative history will include photos and graphics as well as a comprehensive assessment of primary and secondary sources in local, regional, state and national archives.  Oral history interviews will be conducted with present and former NPS staff, park partners, volunteers and others. These interviews will require travel to meet individuals both within the commuting distance of the park and outside of it. The study will be prepared by a professional historian who meets the Secretary of the Interior’s standards for historians and follows the guidelines outlined in Director’s Order 28.\nProject Objectives:\nThis project will result in a published scholarly, and comprehensively updated report bridging the gap between the 1996 report and the present and will be a substantial aid in the documentation of the history of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. This historic report will research and document cultural resources of the park from 1996 to present and is a baseline document. As appropriate, data from this research and the archive of the 1997 administrative history will be added to the park archives and entered into MCMS, and copies of the finished product will be added to the park’s library as well as disseminated to other appropriate areas. A PDF copy will also be made available through the IRMA database for wider access.\nProject milestones include review of previous Administrative History, interviews with current JODA staff, identifying former JODA staff to interview and pertinent oral history questions to ask, gathering of archival data, and the synthesis of the final report. The historian will have monthly meetings with the JODA site supervisor to evaluate progress.\nLocation:\nJohn Day Fossil Beds NM is situated in the John Day River Valley and surrounding lands.

This project is based at three long-term ecohydrological research sites (Soaproot, Newt Creek, and Providence), which are managed by the PSWRS of the USDA FS in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nAt the heart of the USDA Forest Service's mission is their purpose. Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: The participant will engage in field-based research examining the impacts of wildfire and drought-induced tree mortality on water quality and quantity in headwater forest ecosystems.\n\nThe participant will collect water and gas samples from boreholes, soils, and streams, with a focus on capturing spatiotemporal variation in hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to disturbance. Specific activities will include participating in field campaigns to monitor moisture dynamics, collecting and analyzing water samples for major ions, nutrients, water stable isotopes, and carbon isotopes, and assisting in the maintenance and calibration of field instrumentation.\n\nLaboratory activities will involve preparing and analyzing samples using techniques such as ion chromatography and isotope ratio spectroscopy. The participant will collaborate closely with graduate students and project collaborators to synthesize results, compare site responses, and contribute to research on how forest structure and climate extremes shape water availability and watershed function.\n\nLearning Objectives: This opportunity will provide training in hydrologic instrumentation, sample analysis, and environmental data interpretation, supporting the agency’s mission to advance science-based forest and water resource management.\n\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is David Dralle (david.dralle@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: August 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for 3 months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $16,251.10 monthly.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service.
