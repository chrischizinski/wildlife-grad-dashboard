The successful applicant will be hired as a graduate student position beginning in January 2026.\n\nThis project will be focused on assessing the roles of temporary water sources—playas (i.e., ephemeral lake beds), tinajas (i.e., natural bedrock depressions that are spring- or precipitation-fed), etc.—on structuring aerial vertebrate communities in the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts using acoustic monitoring. While the distribution of aquatic organisms is tightly associated with water features, terrestrial species may only visit water a few times each week to drink or hunt for prey. Among terrestrial vertebrates, highly mobile, aerial species (i.e., bats and birds) may provide information on the quality of individual water sources as well as the use of and connectivity among dispersed sources. Many bats and birds remain active in the Southwest year-round where the role of highly ephemeral water sources in structuring their communities is only somewhat understood. Activity of these aerial vertebrates at times when playas or tinajas lack water can reveal insights into the function of these sites beyond water drinking and may inform how a species would be expected to respond under a changing climate. The student will develop exciting questions investigating how bat (and potentially bird) activity and diversity interact with ephemeral water sources in desert landscapes.\n\nThis project is funded through a combination of graduate research assistantships supported by the National Science Foundation’s Long-Term Ecological Research program and the National Park Service’s Southwest Border Resource Protection Program as well as teaching assistantships in the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Ecology. Research will involve collaborative efforts with other university researchers and state/federal agencies. Benefits include an annual salary range of $28,384.56 – $29,698.32, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance.\n\nQualifications:\nRequired: B.S. in wildlife science, biology, conservation ecology, or related field. As you may work on a U.S. military base and make research trips to Sonora, applicants must be a U.S. citizen and possess a valid U.S. driver’s license and valid passport. The successful applicant must also meet the minimum requirements for admission to the NMSU Graduate School (minimum 3.00 GPA). Applicants should also have demonstrated excellent written and oral communication skills, and an ability to work independently. Applicants should have experience working in the backcountry and are willing to lead field crews in rugged, desert terrain in the Jornada Basin (New Mexico) and areas in/adjacent to Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument (Arizona), including El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve (Mexico).\n\nPreference may be given to applicants with an M.S. degree in wildlife science, biology, conservation ecology, or related field and with a GPA of 3.30 or higher. Successful candidates will have experience working in R, an interest in acoustic ecology, and working with large datasets. They should also demonstrate the ability to work as part of a team and have a willingness to lead field work crews. Applicants with experience in processing acoustic data and statistical analyses are encouraged to apply.\n\nThe Laverty Lab is committed to providing a place of work and learning free from discrimination and harassment and encourages applicants from diverse backgrounds.\n\nHow to apply:\nFor consideration, please submit your application using the form on the following link: https://airtable.com/app22ZC66GEtCTx19/shruXqT6iFNwLazdy\n\nThe deadline to apply is 1 October 2025 with interviews for short-listed candidates conducted in mid-October.

    "description": "Fruit Bat Field Technician in Madagascar\nAssociation Ekipa Fanihy (Private) | https://brooklab.org/join/field-technician\nDetails\nPosting:\nhttps://brooklab.org/join/field-technician\nApplication Deadline:\n09/30/2025\nPublished:\n09/05/2025\nStarting Date:\nafter 1/5/2026\nEnding Date:\nafter 12/10/2026\nHours per Week:\n40 - 80\nSalary:\nnone\nEducation Required:\nBachelors\nExperience Required:\nat least 1 year\nLocation:\n3GJF+R4J, Antananarivo, Madagascar (Antananarivo, Madagascar)\nDescription\nThis one-year position, open only to US citizens, will involve organizing and participating in biweekly field expeditions for Ekipa Fanihy (ekipafanihy.org) with one additional tech (also from the US) and a team of Malagasy PhD students from the University of Antananarivo. This position will take over from one of our outgoing techs and overlap a current tech who will remain through August 2026 and be replaced in September 2026.\n\nEkipa Fanihy carries out capture and sampling of Madagascar's fruit bats (Pteropus rufus, Eidolon dupreanum, and Rousettus madagascariensis) at roost sites in the District of Moramanga, Madagascar, with possible extensions to field sites elsewhere. This work supports a long-term field study aimed at deciphering the mechanisms underpinning persistence of potentially zoonotic RNA viruses in wild, Madagascar fruit bats. Bats are reservoirs for several important, highly-virulent zoonoses, including rabies, Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, and SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses. This work also contributes data to population viability analyses and assessments of the conservation status of threatened fruit bats in Madagascar. Please see the Brook lab research page (brooklab.org/research) for further details about the major themes of the project.\n\nField technicians will be trained in the field in January 2026 by the Brook lab manager, Martin Roland, and and one current technician on the job, then supervised remotely (from UC Berkeley) for the duration of the year, interspersed with regular visits from Dr. Brook and other members of the Brook lab.\n\nTechs will spend approximately 70% of their time in the field. During each field mission, techs will travel with University of Antananarivo PhD students for up to 1-2 days to remote field sites in vehicles with hired drivers. While in the field, the team will reside in tents provided by the project for up to two weeks at a time. The work will necessitate strenuous hiking and hauling heavy equipment, sometimes in adverse weather conditions. During field missions, a local cook will be hired to prepare meals, and all expenses (including food) will be funded by the project. \n\nWhile in the field, the field team will capture bats, collect biological samples (blood, urine, feces, saliva, ectoparasites, wing punches), and undertake basic sample preparation (i.e. centrifugation) and storage in liquid nitrogen. The work will be unevenly paced with periods of intense work interspersed with significant downtime; techs will need to be prepared to entertain themselves during this downtime with reading, writing, personal research projects, studying Malagasy, etc. Many field missions will overlap traditional weekends, and techs will be expected to work during these periods.\n\nIn between field missions (30% of the time), techs will live in a shared house in Madagascar's capital city of Antananarivo (housing includes a modern kitchen, ample living space, modern bathroom, WiFi, on-site security, and monthly cleaning services). Each tech will be provided a private bedroom. In Antananarivo ('Tana'), the techs will work with Ekipa Fanihy to further treat, organize, and conduct basic molecular analyses (DNA/RNA extractions, PCR, etc.) of samples at our laboratory at  Madagascar Biodiversity Center (www.madagascarbio.org). Together, the two field techs will be additionally responsible for restocking, packing, and preparation of field supplies for recurring field missions. When weekends overlap with periods of time in the city, techs will have free time to travel locally, take Malagasy lessons, and reset as needed.\n\nWhen not in the field, techs will additionally have opportunities to take part in professional development in the form of remote lab meetings with the Brook Lab at UC Berkeley, as well as receive guidance on the graduate school application process if desired. Field technicians will be acknowledged on publications arising from this work and may or may not be included as co-authors depending on the duration of their employment and the extent of their intellectual contributions to data analysis and interpretation after the field work concludes. Opportunities for independent work--either in science communication or in research--may be pursued on a case-by-case basis.\n\nPlease visit our Brook lab news (brooklab.org/news) page to read prior field technician Katherine McFerrin's blog post, summarizing \"A Day in the Life of a Field Project Manager\" to read what life is like for our team in the field: brooklab.org/news/day-in-the-life. Feel free to reach out to contact former and current Ekipa Fanihy field technicians, Monique Ades (mnades06@gmail.com) or Martin Roland (martincroland@gmail.com), with any questions about the job.\nContact\nCara Brook\ncbrook@berkeley.edu (preferred contact method)",

Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nThe intention is to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations, as stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. The IITF is headquartered in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, and its mission is to develop and disseminate scientifically based knowledge that contributes to the conservation of forests, wildlife, and watersheds of the American tropics in the context of environmental change.\n\nResearch Project: The project fellow will assist in a project that addresses gaps in knowledge of the location and distribution of endemic Caribbean tree species. Using geographic information system methods and tools, research analyses aim to generate regional population size estimates, incorporate land cover and vegetation change maps, geological/environmental variables, and data on endemic tree species to identify locations of high abundance of endemic tree species across the three main archipelagos of the Caribbean (Lucayan, Greater and Lesser Antilles). \n\nThe project approaches include integration of spatially explicit environmental variables including climate, hurricane disturbance, geology and land-use, among other global and Caribbean regional drivers with species distribution models. The project fellow would conduct research and analyses on Caribbean endemic tree species.  The project will use data from permanent forest plots and other sources, focusing on the various Caribbean forest types in the Lucayan, Greater and Lesser Antilles archipelagos. Development of analyses and maps identifying areas with high concentration of endemic species, quantifying land cover and endemic species richness, and other analyses describing forest composition, endemic tree species identified for agroforestry, wood resources, and non-timber uses (fruits, fibers, etc.,), are a goal of this research project. Further project goals are to broadly map endemic species based on land cover to support conservation assessments and management actions in the Caribbean region. The project will address the need to assess the distributions and potential conservation status of tree species as important elements of biodiversity, cultural heritage, and other ecosystem services. \n Learning Objectives: The research fellow will have the opportunity to participate in processes for documenting, organizing, and integrating botanical, geological, climatic, and other environmental data sets. The project will also provide opportunities to learn about forest ecology, forest types, land cover change, species distributions, species ecosystem services, and hurricane disturbance dynamics in Caribbean forests. The fellow will have the opportunity to present analyses and quantitative map outputs in workshops, seminars, reports, and peer-reviewed publications developed and co-authored with mentors and collaborators. The fellow will have ample opportunities to share communications of outputs in various platforms that are expected to serve to inform knowledge of local and regional plant taxonomy, and species distributions for Caribbean tree species.  \nMentor: The mentors for this opportunity is Tamara Heartsill-Scalley (tamara.heartsill-scalley@usda.gov) and Eileen H. Helmer (eileen.helmer@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: January 2026.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for six months if full time but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is part time or full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. Current monthly stipend for this six-month opportunity is $6,000 for a postdoctoral scientist, based on full-time participation. Health, medical and dental, insurance reimbursement up to $547 per month.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits.

Once abundant throughout the Rio Grande and Pecos rivers, minnow populations are now restricted to the Middle Rio Grande and threatened by a combination of water extraction, river regulation, and drought. Population dynamics are strongly linked to hydrology, and managers are interested in strategies to manage minnow populations in average or dry years when declines typically occur. Managers are interested in evaluating alternative strategies for where, when, and the amount of water to be released while balancing the needs of other water users and staying in compliance with the multi-state (Colorado, New Mexico, & Texas) Rio Grande River compact agreement.\n This position will co-lead the development of a structured decision making (SDM) framework and a series of predictive modeling tools. For the SDM component, the postdoc will co-lead a series of annual workshops focused on expert elicitation of model parameters, and model validation. We are developing multiple simulation-based decision support tools such as: an environmental flow model linked to a Bayesian integrated population model for the minnow to predict the outcomes of water management decision at broad scales; and optimization analyses to select a combination of flow and non-flow management actions according to environmental conditions. \n The postdoc will be supervised by Dr. Abby Lawson and Dr. Kasey Pregler of the USGS New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit based at New Mexico State University based at New Mexico State University in the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Ecology, and Dr. Charles Yackulic (USGS Southwest Biological Science Center), while working closely with partners from the Bureau of Reclamation and U.S Fish and Wildlife Service. More information on RGSM conservation efforts in the Middle Rio Grande can be found here. \n Responsibilities:\nCo-lead a series of standing calls and webinars with PIs and interested parties, handle administrative tasks.\nDevelop a series of predictive decision support models to determine optimal allocation of environmental flows under hydrologic conditions paired with, and optimization analyses to identify sets of management actions under uncertainty.\nCo-lead collaborative workshops that will focus on eliciting model parameters, and beta-testing of decision support tools.\nLead the development of multiple manuscripts focused on the environmental flows modeling and other decision analytic tools (e.g., multi-criteria decision analysis, risk analysis, value of information).\n \n\nPosition structure:\nThis announcement is funded for up to two years through a Bureau of Reclamation grant contingent on satisfactory progress. The successful candidate will be hired through New Mexico State University (Las Cruces, NM) and be based on the main campus, though remote options may be considered. The preferred start period is as soon as possible, but a later start date may be considered.\n The postdoctoral researcher will be provided an annual salary ranging between $63,000 – $70,000 depending on experience, plus benefits, a desktop computer (based at NMSU) with high processing speeds, and travel funds to attend conferences and a training opportunity. This position is an excellent opportunity to engage with agency professionals and conduct cutting-edge quantitative research.\n Qualifications:\nMinimum qualifications:\nPh.D. degree by start date in Wildlife, Fisheries, Ecology, or related field by the anticipated start date (preferred late fall 2025)\nExpertise in R coding language.\nDemonstrated desire and proven ability to publish in peer-reviewed journals.\nExcellent written and personal communication skills\nThe ability to work both independently and collaboratively, and to meet deadlines.\n Desired qualifications:\nCompetitive candidates will have a background in one or more of the following areas*: modeling of environmental flows, stochastic simulations, Bayesian hierarchical modeling of population dynamics, constructing GUI-based decision support tools (e.g., R-shiny apps, Python, NetLogo, etc.), optimization analysis, or structured decision making.\n *Note: We do not expect a single candidate to possess all or most of these skills, as will join a team that includes other researchers and mentors with experience in these areas. These skills reflect ideal, but not required qualifications. We have some project funding for the postdoc to attend a training opportunity, so the selected applicant may learn these skills on the job.\n How to apply:\nSubmit an application through our online portal (link below). Applicants will be asked to provide the following: (1) a writing sample (such as a published manuscript or Ph.D. dissertation), (2) letter of interest that describes your qualifications and how this position fits into your career goals; (3) CV or resume that includes contact information (phone and email) for at least three references; (4) unofficial transcripts from your PhD institution.\n Applications will be reviewed as they are received, though the position will remain open until a suitable candidate is found.

We engage youth (age 15-17) and young adults (ages 18-30, up to 35 for veterans) in service projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. Our AmeriCorps positions provide impactful educational and service opportunities that benefit both communities and landscapes. SECC’s participants reflect the population of the Southeast region, including youth, graduates, veterans, and individuals from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. \nSECC collaborates with land management agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, local municipalities, and non-profits to host day and camping crews. Our projects vary but include trail construction and maintenance, restoration of natural areas, invasive species removal, fire fuels reduction, fencing, herbicide applications, and more. Most projects involve strenuous manual labor and require hiking to and from the project sites daily, carrying tools and day packs.   \n SECC camping crews serve and camp overnight in front country and backcountry locations, often in challenging weather conditions. While hitch schedules vary by project and location, they typically follow a 9-day on, 5-day off pattern, with 10-hour shifts and scheduled breaks throughout the day. While we aim to maintain consistency, flexibility is expected as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change based on project needs.   \n SECC is an independent, non-residential program, and crew members are responsible for securing their own housing when not in the field. On-hitch, crews manage camp chores and prepare all their own meals, with evenings often including group discussions. Members must provide their own personal outdoor gear (e.g., tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, multi-day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots), while SECC provides group camp equipment, tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC Office and project sites. \n Description of Duties  \n Service Project:  \nSECC and the Cherokee National Forest have partnered to host a Stream Restoration Felling & Rigging Crew. The crew will be based out of SECC’s office in Chattanooga, TN and travel to complete conservation service projects along the Citico Creek Watershed and other streams in the Cherokee National Forest. The crew will be managed by the Cherokee National Forest and will support their fisheries biologists and hydrologists.  \n Crew members will collaborate as a team to assist in activities that support native fish and other important aquatic resources on the Cherokee National Forest, TN. The primary focus of the season will be habitat improvement through strategic wood placement on select streams utilizing grip hoist rigging techniques and chainsaws to selectively place trees into stream channels.  \n During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors in all weather conditions, performing heavy manual labor to complete conservation and restoration projects. Most projects require hiking through difficult terrain while carrying gear (up to 50lbs) to remote work sites for the day. We ask that crew members embrace learning opportunities, face challenges, and build community with their crew.  \n Project Duties:  \nWith appropriate training and under the guidance of a crew leader, use tools (chainsaws, grip hoist, hand tools, pulleys, levers) to place trees into streams to create woody habitat structures for aquatic species. Although orientations will be implemented, applicants with a strong background in chainsaw felling and rigging are encouraged to apply. \nTransport gear (up to 50lbs/crew member) daily across difficult terrain \nCollaborate as a team with a high degree of coordination and communication \nKeep a positive attitude and follow directions while conducting physically demanding projects, often in inclement weather.  \nMaintain equipment and report maintenance/equipment needs to supervisor.  \nCollaborate on field design and implementation of structures to enhance stream morphology.  \nOperate in areas with no cellular service.  \nPerform all duties with safety as top priority.  \nMaintain a high level of integrity while in the field. \n Note: While the staff at SECC and partners strive to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs. \n Opportunities to Extend Your Service \nSECC’s winter crew members have the opportunity to focus on developing their technical and interpersonal skills throughout their season to prepare for taking on potential member or leadership roles with SECC during the remainder of the year. Please be prepared to discuss your interest in continuing your service through summer/fall. \n Note: placement in member or leadership positions are not guaranteed and will be based on qualifications, performance, work ethic, and ability. We highly encourage those who participate to stay on throughout the summer.   \n  Crew Life:    \nSECC crews consist of 4-6 crew members and 2 crew leaders who provide project expertise, mentorship, training, and support to ensure the success of all participants. Food is provided while in the field, and crew members collaborate to plan meals and share chores, such as cooking and washing dishes. Most dietary restrictions can be accommodated if communicated in advance. Crew members must be prepared to camp, travel, complete service projects, and share meals as a team. No drug or alcohol consumption is allowed during service-related activities or travel at any time.   \n Crew members will need to supply their own personal equipment such as a day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots, etc. SECC will provide tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC office and project sites. SECC has a limited supply of loaner gear available for crew members to borrow. While this gear can be helpful, we strongly recommend that members bring as much of their own gear as possible, as the loaner equipment may not fully meet personal preferences or specific needs. \n SECC supports a culture of feedback and growth. Crew Members will set goals at the beginning of the season and review their performance through both self-evaluation and a review with their Crew Leader in the middle and at the end of their season. Evaluations will cover areas such as professionalism, responsibility and leadership, communication, engagement, productivity, safety, and equipment use. Crew Members will also be asked to evaluate their Crew Leaders’ performance, the overall program, and their experience at the end of their term.  \n     Hitch Schedule:     \nThis position will operate on a variable “hitch” schedule, but generally it will follow 9 days on and 5 days off for camping crews.

We engage youth (age 15-17) and young adults (ages 18-30, up to 35 for veterans) in service projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. Our AmeriCorps positions provide impactful educational and service opportunities that benefit both communities and landscapes. SECC’s participants reflect the population of the Southeast region, including youth, graduates, veterans, and individuals from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. \n SECC collaborates with land management agencies such as the United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, local municipalities, and non-profits to host day and camping crews. Our projects vary but include trail construction and maintenance, restoration of natural areas, invasive species removal, fire fuels reduction, fencing, herbicide applications, and more. Most projects involve strenuous manual labor and require hiking to and from the project sites daily, carrying tools and day packs.   \n SECC camping crews serve in frontcountry and backcountry locations, often in challenging weather conditions. While hitch schedules vary by project and location, they typically follow a 9-day on, 5-day off pattern, with 10-hour shifts and scheduled breaks throughout the day. While we aim to maintain consistency, flexibility is expected as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change based on project needs.   \n SECC is an independent, non-residential program, and crew members are responsible for securing their own housing when not in the field. On-hitch, crews manage camp chores and prepare all their own meals, with evenings often including group discussions. Members must provide their own personal outdoor gear (e.g., tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, day pack, multi-day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots), while SECC provides group camp equipment, tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC Office and project sites. \n   Description of Duties \nDuring their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors in all weather conditions, performing heavy manual labor to complete conservation and restoration projects. Most projects require hiking out to remote work sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack. We ask that crew members embrace learning opportunities, face challenges, and build community with their crew.  \n  Service Project:   \nSECC and Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area (LBL) have partnered to host a Prescribed Fire and Recreation Crew. The crew will be based out of SECCs Chattanooga, TN office and travel to Kentucky to complete conservation projects around LBL, with a primary focus on trail recreation projects and fire management operations. The crew will be managed by LBL Forest Service staff to complete their conservation projects.  \n Service projects will vary depending on seasonal factors and safety considerations. Weather can especially have a significant impact on fire operations. When it comes to prescribed fire operations, the project is dependent on the weather. While the staff at SECC and partners strive to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs.  \n Most projects require hiking out to project sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack.  \nThe projects will vary based on priorities and environmental factors but will focus on: \nHazard tree removal and sawyer work, including felling, bucking, limbing, swamping, etc.  \nTraditional trail building/maintenance, including logging out, brushing, reblazing, tread repair, water-bar installation, etc.   \nRecreation site improvements including trailhead and signage maintenance/replacement.  \nRestoration/stabilization of shelters and other structures \nEstablishment of prescribed fire containment line, completed with traditional wildland firefighting tools, such as: leaf blower, fire rake, rogue hoe, Mcleod, Pulaski, etc. \n *Note: the above projects are in support of fire mitigation, fuels reduction, or developed recreation; this crew will not participate in wildland fire. The ability to complete prescribed fire operations does depend on the weather. For this reason, we cannot guarantee the number of prescribed burns the crew will partake in.*   \n Members will earn the following training and certifications: \n*Members may not exceed 20% of their total term hours as trainings \nICS-100 (Intro to Incident Command System)  \nIS-700 (Intro to the National Incident Management System)  \nS-130 (Firefighter Training)  \nS-190 (Into to Wildland Fire Behavior)  \nL-180 (Human Factors in Wildland Fire Service)  \nUSFS chainsaw recognized certifications  \nRed Card via successful completion of the Moderate Pack Test  \n2-mile hike in 30 minutes with 25 pounds  \nFirst Aid/CPR training  \n (Crews will spend the first three weeks of their season completing onboarding, receiving their First Aid/CPR, chainsaw related certifications in Chattanooga, and all fire related training at Land Between the Lakes NRA) \n Opportunities to Extend Your Service \nSECC’s winter crew members have the opportunity to focus on developing their technical and interpersonal skills throughout their season to prepare for taking on potential member or leadership roles with SECC during the remainder of the year. Please be prepared to discuss your interest in continuing your service through summer/fall. \n Note: placement in member or leadership positions are not guaranteed and will be based on qualifications, performance, work ethic, and ability. We highly encourage those who participate to stay on throughout the summer.   \n  Crew Life:    \nSECC crews consist of 4-6 crew members and 2 crew leaders who provide project expertise, mentorship, training, and support to ensure the success of all participants. Food is provided while in the field, and crew members collaborate to plan meals and share chores, such as cooking and washing dishes. Most dietary restrictions can be accommodated if communicated in advance. Crew members must be prepared to camp, travel, complete service projects, and share meals as a team. No drug or alcohol consumption is allowed during service-related activities or travel at any time.   \n Crew members will need to supply their own personal equipment such as a day pack, work pants, hiking/work boots, etc. SECC will provide tools, protective gear and transportation between SECC office and project sites. SECC has a limited supply of loaner gear available for crew members to borrow. While this gear can be helpful, we strongly recommend that members bring as much of their own gear as possible, as the loaner equipment may not fully meet personal preferences or specific needs. \n SECC supports a culture of feedback and growth. Crew Members will set goals at the beginning of the season and review their performance through both self-evaluation and a review with their Crew Leader in the middle and at the end of their season. Evaluations will cover areas such as professionalism, responsibility and leadership, communication, engagement, productivity, safety, and equipment use. Crew Members will also be asked to evaluate their Crew Leaders’ performance, the overall program, and their experience at the end of their term.  \n     Hitch Schedule:     \nThis position will operate on a variable “hitch” schedule, but generally it will follow 9 days on and 5 days off for camping crews. Project days follow a 10-hour shift with scheduled time for breaks. While the staff at SECC strive to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs.  Applicants should be prepared to camp during hitches for the duration of the season, with lodging provided on a case-by-case basis if necessary.    \n  Requirements:     \n Minimum Qualifications:       \nUnited States citizen, United States national, or a lawful permanent resident alien \nMust be between ages 18 and 30, or up to 35 if a military veteran.   \nHas received a high school diploma or equivalency certificate; or has not dropped out of elementary or secondary school to enroll as an AmeriCorps participant, and agrees to obtain a high school diploma or its equivalent prior to using the education award \nAgrees to provide information to establish eligibility and to complete a National Service Criminal History Check. \n  Preferred Qualifications:    \nGeneral comfort with and prior experience in outdoor environments.  \nUSFS recognized Chainsaw A feller \n  Our Commitment: \nConservation Legacy is committed to the full inclusion of all qualified individuals and will ensure that persons with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodations to perform essential functions.
