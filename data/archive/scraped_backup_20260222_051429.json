The successful applicant will begin in the Fall 2026 semester.\n\nRio Grande cutthroat trout (RGCT) are the southernmost species of cutthroat trout and have experienced a severe decline in both range and abundance, now occupying only ~12 percent of its historical distribution and requires targeted management interventions to support recovery. Major components of the recovery plan detail the need to secure extant populations and reintroduce individuals within their native range in Colorado and New Mexico. Recent efforts to date include development of a multi-source, genetically diverse broodstock for the Rio Grande basin that is used for reintroduction efforts.\n\nIndividuals from this multi-source broodstock were stocked at multiple sites throughout the recently restored Rio Costilla watershed which represents one of the largest native fish restoration projects in the country. While recent research has shown that this composite broodstock is more genetically diverse compared to using single source populations there is a need to evaluate how these fish are performing in the wild. The present project has a number of goals:\n\n          1. Evaluate genetic structure and diversity of reintroduced Rio Costilla RGCT populations\n                     a. There is also opportunity to develop questions with demographic monitoring data in this system.\n          2. Genetic assessment of Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos basins. \n                     a. Results will help inform multi-source broodstock development for Canadian & Pecos basins and identify additional source populations for Rio Grande basin.\n                     b. Results will also provide an updated genetic assessment for RGCT.\n          3. There are additional opportunities for the student to develop their own questions using genetic and demographic data.\n\nThis project is a collaborative effort funded by the New Mexico Department of Wildlife and there may be potential to collaborate with other university researchers and agencies. Benefits include a salary range of ~$28-29k/year, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance. Funding will also be available for conference travel, workshop training for data analyses, and safety training (e.g., wilderness first aid). The hired candidate will begin in Fall 2026 and will be based at NMSU in Las Cruces, NM.\n\nHow to apply: If interested, please compile the following: (1) a statement of interest that describes your educational and research background, as well as your research interests and how this position fits in your career goals (2) curriculum vitae or resume, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts compiled in a single PDF and save as ‘Lastname_RGCT_PhD.pdf’.  Applicants are also asked to upload a writing sample in the application portal. Applications should be submitted through the airtable linked here:  https://airtable.com/app3jNqbQZsYstwx7/pagrpU5GqaI6FnSTg/form \n\nApplications are due 03/18/26 by 11:59p MT.

    "requirements": "RIO GRANDE CUTTHROAT TROUT PHD ASSISTANTSHIP\n\nDescription & project background: \n\nThe Pregler Lab at New Mexico State University in the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Ecology invites applications for a PhD research assistantship focused on Rio Grande cutthroat trout conservation. The successful applicant will begin in the Fall 2026 semester.\n\nRio Grande cutthroat trout (RGCT) are the southernmost species of cutthroat trout and have experienced a severe decline in both range and abundance, now occupying only ~12 percent of its historical distribution and requires targeted management interventions to support recovery. Major components of the recovery plan detail the need to secure extant populations and reintroduce individuals within their native range in Colorado and New Mexico. Recent efforts to date include development of a multi-source, genetically diverse broodstock for the Rio Grande basin that is used for reintroduction efforts.\n\nIndividuals from this multi-source broodstock were stocked at multiple sites throughout the recently restored Rio Costilla watershed which represents one of the largest native fish restoration projects in the country. While recent research has shown that this composite broodstock is more genetically diverse compared to using single source populations there is a need to evaluate how these fish are performing in the wild. The present project has a number of goals:\n\n          1. Evaluate genetic structure and diversity of reintroduced Rio Costilla RGCT populations\n                     a. There is also opportunity to develop questions with demographic monitoring data in this system.\n          2. Genetic assessment of Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos basins. \n                     a. Results will help inform multi-source broodstock development for Canadian & Pecos basins and identify additional source populations for Rio Grande basin.\n                     b. Results will also provide an updated genetic assessment for RGCT.\n          3. There are additional opportunities for the student to develop their own questions using genetic and demographic data.\n\nThis project is a collaborative effort funded by the New Mexico Department of Wildlife and there may be potential to collaborate with other university researchers and agencies. Benefits include a salary range of ~$28-29k/year, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance. Funding will also be available for conference travel, workshop training for data analyses, and safety training (e.g., wilderness first aid). The hired candidate will begin in Fall 2026 and will be based at NMSU in Las Cruces, NM.\n\nHow to apply: If interested, please compile the following: (1) a statement of interest that describes your educational and research background, as well as your research interests and how this position fits in your career goals (2) curriculum vitae or resume, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts compiled in a single PDF and save as ‘Lastname_RGCT_PhD.pdf’.  Applicants are also asked to upload a writing sample in the application portal. Applications should be submitted through the airtable linked here:  https://airtable.com/app3jNqbQZsYstwx7/pagrpU5GqaI6FnSTg/form \n\nApplications are due 03/18/26 by 11:59p MT.

Assistantship – Raven Movement Ecology in Prairie Canada\nDr. Adam Janke & Dr. Gunnar Kramer – Iowa State University\nDr. Jay VonBank, Dr. Todd Arnold, Dr. Frank Rohwer & Jacob Bushaw – Delta Waterfowl Foundation\n PROJECT BACKGROUND\nDelta Waterfowl, in collaboration with Iowa State University (ISU), is recruiting a highly motivated M.S. student to investigate the movement ecology of common ravens and their role in waterfowl nest depredation within the prairie/parkland ecosystems of Saskatchewan, Canada. Ravens represent a relatively new and increasingly abundant nest predator in this region, and their expanding distribution poses emerging challenges for waterfowl reproductive success.\n This research will focus on quantifying spatial and temporal movement patterns of ravens using advanced GPS telemetry. The student will investigate how raven movement strategies, habitat-use dynamics, and associated behaviors contribute to waterfowl nest depredation. Results from this work will directly inform predator management strategies to enhance conservation planning for waterfowl populations within the northern Prairie Pothole Region. The selected candidate will collaborate closely with scientists from Delta Waterfowl and Iowa State University. Field operations will begin in April 2026 in Saskatchewan, and the graduate assistantship will formally begin at Iowa State University, Ames, IA, in August 2026.\n The assistantship is supported by a combination of teaching and research assistantships that provides a $28,800 per year stipend, health insurance, and a 75% tuition waiver.\n REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS \n• B.S. in ecology, wildlife biology, wildlife management, or a related discipline \n• Eligibility for admission to Iowa State University (including a GPA >3.0)\n• Demonstrated commitment to high-quality, collaborative scientific research\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS \n• Prior experience in movement ecology, avian ecology, or waterfowl nesting ecology \n• Experience with avian capture, safe handling procedures, or deployment of tracking transmitters \n• Ability to identify waterfowl species, particularly breeding hens \n• Proficiency in data management, statistical analysis, and movement-modeling frameworks \n• Strong interpersonal skills, with demonstrated ability to work independently and lead field crews under challenging conditions\n\nAPPLICATION DEADLINE: March 1, 2026 (applications will be reviewed as they are received)\nTo apply, please submit application materials (CV with contact information for 3 professional references, unofficial transcripts, and a cover letter describing career goals and professional interests) to https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2esiV8HjWy7oS3eF9SkcsbqDyMR12WYAkJQx4OOFVvBTeMA/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=106907810723402985289. \n For additional information contact:\nDr. Gunnar Kramer: grk@iastate.edu\nDr. Adam Janke: ajanke@iastate.edu\nDr. Jay VonBank: jvonbank@deltawaterfowl.org\n\nContact\nJay VonBank\njvonbank@deltawaterfowl.org (preferred contact method)",

Deschutes County, Oregon represents the northwestern-most extent of the species range and lies far outside the extant range of pinyon pine species. Extensive treatments of juniper woodlands have been expedited throughout western states for restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, sage grouse habitat, and altered fire regimes. However, we lack clear understanding of how these treatments impact PIJA populations.  \n\nManagement priorities for PIJA in Oregon include assessing impacts of juniper treatments on PIJA and determining state-wide distribution. The primary goals of this project are to experimentally study how juniper treatments impact occupancy, habitat use, and nesting of PIJA on BLM lands in Deschutes County, Oregon. We are implementing a before-after-control-impact study and use bioacoustics monitoring, point counts, and nest searching methods. The MS project will focus on at least one component of the project. This work is in partnership with the East Cascades Bird Alliance, US Fish and Wildlife, and Deschutes BLM. We also contribute to the PIJA Western Working Group and the PIJA Conservation Action Strategy (CAS). The MS candidate will be expected to coordinate with and contribute findings to larger range-wide intiatives. \n\nLOCATION & PROGRAM: This position supports a student in the Masters of Science in Natural Resources at Oregon Tech in Klamath Falls, OR.

Oregon Tech is on a quarter system. Fall, Winter, and Spring terms are 11 weeks. Our academic year runs from mid-September to Mid-June.  The GTA provides a per-term stipend and partial tuition remission during the academic year (Fall through Spring terms). In addition, this research assistantship will provide additional part-time stipend during the spring term, and full-time hourly salary over the summer. Some travel costs from Klamath Falls to Bend, OR will be covered. The graduate student will be expected to use their own vehicle, preferably one that can handle rugged, rocky roads to access field sites. If the student would prefer to forgo the GTA position and cover their own academic costs, that would be an option. \n\nPOSITION REQUIREMENTS: The candidate should have a Bachelors degree in Natural Resources, Wildlife, Ecology, Environmental Science or a closely related program of study and should meet the requirements for acceptance into the Masters of Natural Resources program at Oregon Tech. Ideally, the applicant will have at least 2 years of field experience studying birds, particularly nest searching and point counts.

One of those openings will be devoted to assisting with the long-term monitoring of forest insects present in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF). \n\nStudents will work with research teams involving other undergraduate and graduate students, studying the biota and ecology of HBEF. The REU students will develop and conduct an independent research project under the supervision of their mentor. Many REU students continue their work as an independent study or senior honors thesis at their home institution. Additionally, through weekly on-site presentations given by the mentors and other scientists, students are also exposed to a full spectrum of ecosystem research at Hubbard Brook. The program runs from late May to mid-August. Students receive a stipend of $5500 for the 10-week program, as well as housing. Limited funding is available for research supplies and travel expenses. Students live at HBRF’s researcher housing adjacent to HBEF, among a community of summer field students and technicians. All residents are expected to share and cooperate with cleaning, cooking, and related chores.\n Lepidoptera / Forest insect community: This project aims to understand more about the Lepidoptera (moths and caterpillars) community, the most important herbivores in northern hardwood forests and a critical link from plant production to consumers like birds and bats. We will work with the insect-REU student to develop a project that may include elements such as building a photographic library of the moths and caterpillars within Hubbard Brook, collecting forest insect samples using various field methods, developing both manual and AI-assisted methods for identifying and enumerating moths (and other insect orders), as well as other research avenues to be determined by the student and mentors. Due to the Lepidoptera and forest insect work being closely linked to bird and bat research, the student will learn and participate in long-term bird research including nest searching and counting food availability, as well as participate in bat research and bioacoustics monitoring. Through this opportunity, the student will have ample access to a multitude of research questions to explore and a chance to contribute to new knowledge in forest ecosystem dynamics.\n In your application, please include: a letter explaining why a summer research project interests you and how it fits into your broader plans, your resume and email contact for two references (they do not need to submit letters). Applications are due by March 6.\n\nIf interested in the position, please send your application to Dr. Matt Ayres (Dartmouth College: matthew.p.ayres@dartmouth.edu) and Jessica Jones (Dartmouth College: jessica.s.jones.gr@dartmouth.edu). \n\nContact\nJessica Jones\njessica.s.jones.gr@dartmouth.edu (preferred contact method)",

DAWR is tasked with protecting Guam’s natural resources by working through partnerships to conserve and manage fish and wildlife and their habitats for the use and enjoyment of current and future generations. In particular, the Wildlife Office works closely with Guam's native bird and bat species, specifically the Guam rail (Ko'ko'), Guam kingfisher (Sihek), Micronesian Starling (Såli), Mariana swiftlet (Yayaguak), Mariana moorhen (Pulattat), and Mariana fruit bat (Fanihi). We also work to educate the public about invasive species such as the brown treensnake and the threats they pose to native wildlife. DAWR also collaborates with federal agencies and local environmental groups on conservation projects in pursuit of wildlife restoration on Guam.\n\nDetails & Responsibilities\n\nThis person will contribute to DAWR's monitoring of Guam's native bird and bat species. Avian monitoring methods include point count surveys, audio playbacks and recordings, camera trapping, nest monitoring, and radio telemetry. Bat colonies are monitored via roost counts and flyover surveys. The majority of work will take place in the field, primarily on Islan Dåno' (Cocos Island), a small islet off the southern coast of Guam (daily boat transportation provided) but also in other forest and watershed habitats across Guam. This will include species identification and monitoring, data collection, and maintenance of equipment and survey stations. Additionally, this person will be responsible for data entry and database management in the office, and will assist with data analysis and report writing.\n\nBiologists also participate in public outreach events and classroom visits with trained education birds. On a limited basis, this person may also assist in husbandry for DAWR's captive breeding programs of Guam rail and Guam kingfisher. There may be opportunities for additional trainings and off-island travel for conferences and workshops.\n\nBenefits\n\nThis is a full-time, permanent position with the Government of Guam and comes with full health care and retirement benefits, sick leave, holidays, and vacation hours. We will likely be able to provide some relocation assistance, such as a one-way plane ticket to Guam and a small sum for other relocation expenses, though we cannot guarantee this at this time.\n\nQualifications\n \nApplicants must have graduated from a recognized college or university with a Bachelor’s degree in biology, wildlife science, fishery science, zoology or related fields. Applicants must also have a valid U.S. driver's license, and be prepared to work outdoors in Guam's hot, humid, tropical climate.\n \nPreferred experience: \n· field experience in avian monitoring techniques \n· experience with ARUs, trail cameras, GPS, and radio telemetry \n· experience with basic statistical analysis and report writing \n· familiarity with Guam's ecosystems and species \n· the ability to work both independently and as part of a team \n· a strong work ethic, and a willingness to learn \n\n How to Apply\n\nJob posting: https://hr.doa.guam.gov/wp-hr-content/uploads/2026/01/BIOLOGIST-I-OPEN-DOA09-26.pdf\nFlyer/info: https://www.guamcoralreefs.info/opportunities/wildlife-biologist\nDOA application form: https://hr.doa.guam.gov/wp-hr-content/uploads/2026/01/Govt-Guam-Employment-Application-Form-12-18-25.pdf\n\nApplicants should combine the following items in a single PDF and email it to: doajobs@doa.guam.gov  \n· official DOA application form (link above; contains further submission details) \n· CV / resume \n· copy of official undergraduate transcript \n· copy of Bachelor's degree \n· copy of driver's license \n\n Questions?\n \nEmail Lauren at lauren.thompson@doag.guam.gov \nContact\nLauren Thompson\nlauren.thompson@doag.guam.gov (preferred contact method)",
