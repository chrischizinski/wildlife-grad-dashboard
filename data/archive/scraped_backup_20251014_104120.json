South Campus Dr. (Tucson, Arizona)\nTags:\nGraduate Opportunities\nDescription\nPhD Student Opportunity: Fall 2026. The Tigreros Lab is recruiting a highly motivated PhD student to study the intricate ways environmental stress shapes life histories, behavior, and species interactions in insect herbivores. Our research is fundamentally integrative and interdisciplinary. We combine advanced controlled laboratory techniques (e.g., metabolic assays, stable isotope tracing) with field studies in natural and agricultural systems.\n\nStudents will have the flexibility and support to develop independent research projects. Areas of potential investigation include:\n\n·         Stress and Life-History Strategies: How nutritional and climatic stressors mediate critical life history trade-offs (e.g., dispersal vs. reproduction, offspring number vs. quality).\n·         Carry-over and Maternal Effects: Analyzing the long-term impact of early-life environmental stress on adult traits and the fitness of subsequent generations.\n·         Multi-Stressors and Adaptation: Comparative and population-level studies investigating phenotypic plasticity and adaptation to multiple, interacting stressors (e.g., nutritional, thermal, and predation threats).\n·         Insecticides and Non-Target Organisms: Determining the lasting effects and underlying mechanisms by which common insecticides impact non-target insects, including pollinators and predators.\n\nWe welcome applicants from diverse backgrounds in ecology, evolutionary biology, physiology, or entomology. Ideal candidates will have a passion for quantitative, interdisciplinary research that combines both lab and field methods.\n\nTo Apply: To express your interest, please email Dr. Natasha Tigreros (ntm@arizona.edu). The email should briefly describe your research interests (a few sentences), and attach your CV/Resume and a copy of your unofficial transcripts (undergraduate and graduate, if applicable).

MS Concentrations include Conservation Biology, Environmental Education, Advocacy for Social Justice and Sustainability, and several others. In Conservation Biology, students focus on gaining quantitative (GIS and statistics), writing, and ecological field skills. Students also gain experience with community engagement, social justice, and applied research and service. \n\nStudents can earn their graduate degree with either face-to-face classes at the Antioch University New England campus in Keene, NH, USA, or fully online classes (that can be taken from anywhere) which are offered each semester, or with a mixture of the two. Ecological field trip classes (intensive 1-2 week trips to destinations abroad and in-country) are also available for all students. All classes are just 1-2 days a week, making this a viable program for environmental professionals working part or full-time. Our programs are student-centered, flexible, and tailored to meet your individual needs, learning style, and location.\n\nStudents often work with Antioch faculty in our existing research programs. Specifically in our Conservation Biology concentration, we have expertise in vertebrate ecology (e.g., birds, snakes), invertebrate ecology (e.g., estuarine invertebrates, insects), tropical ecology, forest ecology, alpine ecology, marine ecology, and coastal restoration. In some cases, faculty may have extramural funding to support students in seasonal field and lab positions, including research in New England and in the Caribbean. Students who are eligible for US federal work-study can also work part time in various on-campus work-study positions, including Graduate Teaching and Research Assistantships and various positions in our numerous campus centers (e.g., Institute for International Conservation, Spatial Analysis Lab). However, you need to be accepted and taking classes as a graduate student to be eligible for these work-study positions. Students at Antioch generally pay for at least part of their own tuition, but we offer numerous university-wide grants and scholarships, which can help defray tuition costs, and which are detailed here: https://www.antioch.edu/admission-aid/financial-aid/scholarships-and-grants/ . We also work with students to help them apply for external scholarships, fellowships, and research-focused grants.\n\n\nJoin our tight-knit community as we strive to advance social and environmental justice, conserve biodiversity, and mitigate climate change as a department and as a university!

Working primarily at Caño Palma Biological Station (CPBS) and making regular expeditions into the cloud forest, you’ll gain hands-on experience that opens doors to senior-level roles in global conservation.\n\nWho would make a great fellow?\nA well-read conservationist, comfortable applying common statistical approaches\n·       Minimum of a Masters or PhD in biology, ecology, or other related subject, with thesis development and research component (this is essential).\n·       Knowledge/familiarity with Neotropical biology/ecology.\n·       Working knowledge and competence with common statistical approaches and tools (R preferred).\nA leader that is easygoing, but able to manage young researchers:\n·       Experience undertaking fieldwork in challenging conditions (tropics preferred).\n·       Record of coordinating volunteers, student groups, or independent researchers.\n·       Interest in mentoring long-term students on individual research projects.\nAn excellent communicator\n·       Fluency in English and proficiency (at minimum) in spoken and written Spanish (all official documents and meetings are in Spanish. \n·       Experience identifying trends and writing research reports to change the behaviour of external parties. \n·       Experience living in close quarters, with well-developed conflict resolution skills. \n\nIMPORTANT! We don’t expect the Research Supervisor to meet every single competency — we encourage you to apply and acknowledge gaps in knowledge or experience.  \n\nWhat will the fellow do?\nAs Research Supervisor, you’ll play a central role in shaping COTERC’s scientific agenda — from coordinating long-term monitoring at Caño Palma to pioneering new projects in the cloud forest. You’ll mentor and train interns and volunteers, guiding them through the rigours of field research while ensuring data integrity and safety standards. Beyond the station, you’ll engage with local communities and government agencies, turning research into action that advances conservation goals. Your work will contribute directly to applied reports, peer-reviewed publications, and the sustainable management of one of the world’s most biodiverse regions.\n•       Coordinate long-term monitoring projects at CPBS (for a list of projects and relevant publications, see www.coterc.org) \n•       Train and supervise interns and volunteers on data collection across research projects. \n•       Develop new projects in line with COTERC’s evolving research agenda. \n•       Contribute to species conservation and area management through the production of applied reports and peer-reviewed papers. \n•       Work with local communities and government agencies to promote conservation practices. \n•       Oversee the management of project data, supported by the Director of Data Integrity. \n•       Support the Station Manager in the management of the site, ensuring health and safety policies are followed by all. \n\nWhat can we offer the fellow?\n•       Full room and board at Caño Palma Biological Station.\n•       $600/month stipend.\n•       $200 bonus every three months.\n•       $1,000 bonus at the successful completion of 1 year contract.\n\nMost importantly, you’ll gain unparalleled experience leading research and conservation efforts in two extraordinary ecosystems. This is a stepping-stone into senior roles across academia, NGOs, and global conservation leadership.\n\nHow to apply\nSend your application (cover letter, CV, and 2–3 professional references — no more than 3 pages total 11pt font) to applications@coterc.org   \nApplication review and interviews begin immediately — we encourage you to apply as soon as possible.\nFor more about COTERC and our work, visit:\n🌐 www.coterc.org\n📘 www.facebook.com/COTERC  \n\nContact\nDr Tom Bregman\napplications@coterc.org (preferred contact method)",

Hurricanes have only recently gained recognition as an ecologically important and recurrent disturbance, with most forests in the Southeast experiencing cyclone-force winds about every six years. Understanding how these storms influence ecosystem structure and function is critical for predicting future dynamics in a region experiencing both intensifying storm regimes and rapid environmental change.\n\nThis proposed research will investigate the long-term impacts of hurricanes on community composition using established long-term monitoring datasets. By combining these data with a historical record of hurricane windfields, the student will examine how single or repeated exposure to storms shapes patterns of plant diversity, abundance, and recovery over time. In addition, the project will explore how management interventions, such as prescribed fire or salvage logging, influence the trajectory of community composition following disturbance.

Help advance science about tropical montane forest bird communities. Learn how to collect data to determine community and species-level responses to deforestation, forest recovery, forest fragmentation, and landscape and climate changes. Your participation helps sustain an important protected area in the mega-diverse Choco Endemic Bird Area (EBA). \n\nCost-share volunteers/trainees assist Dr. Dusti Becker with long-term avian monitoring and conservation in the Andes at the beautiful forest protected area, Reserva las Tangaras.  In exchange volunteers receive experience-based training in mist netting and bird banding, including the use of Hall traps and practice with hummingbird banding. \n\nTeam Dates:      August 9-22, 2026 (6 positions available)\n\n                             December 7-20, 2026 (2 positions available)\n\nWhere:  Reserva Las Tangaras, a 130-acre nature preserve, boasts more than 25 species of hummingbirds, dozens of colorful tanagers, the largest regional Andean cock-of-the-rock display lek, along with over 300 tropical bird species, many of which are Choco and Andean endemics. During the expedition, LNN teams typically detect around 175 - 200 different species of birds in the reserve and study area. Team members always see additional bird species while traveling to and from the project site. The reserve is also home to endangered capuchin monkeys, spectacled bears, cougars, and myriads of other wildlife species, including several rare and endangered rain frogs. \n\nActivities: Volunteers are trained (or refreshed on) setting up and monitoring mist nets, extracting birds from nets, carrying birds from nets to banding stations, and recording ornithological and ecological data in the field. Volunteers are also trained to band birds and make standard measurements of birds. Volunteers also learn about Hall trapping and banding hummingbirds. The site is rugged, requiring above average fitness including: ability to hike on steep, potentially muddy and slippery terrain, and cover 2-4 miles on foot per day. Back or joint impairments, or obesity may make the project too challenging for some. \n\nVolunteers will have time to explore the Mindo area, and the team visits higher-elevation Bellavista Cloud Forest Reserve on the last day before returning to Quito. The December team will participate in the Mindo Christmas Bird Count (CBC), which typically wins first or second place globally for bird species counted. \n\nFood and Lodging: Accommodation is in a spacious research cabin, where each participant has a single bed mattress with mosquito netting, pillow, and fitted sheet. Two showers with hot water and flush toilets provide comfortable field accommodations. Meals are delicious, home-style Ecuadorian, prepared by excellent cooks, and vegetarian diets can be accommodated. \n\nCOST: Your contribution of $2450 covers transportation during the field project to and from Quito,Ecuador, meals at RLT, lodging at RLT, reserve entrance fees, salaries for Ecuadorian cooks and para-biologists, leader's costs, and a special lunch at the Bellavista Reserve. Airfare to and from Quito, Ecuador and expenses in Quito before and after the expedition are not included. Meals away from RLT during project are not included. \n\nYour cost-share helps sustain Reserva las Tangaras, supporting year-round stewardship, educational programs, outreach materials about cloud forest wildlife, maintenance of trails and signs, cabin repairs, and feeding of resident hummingbirds. Cost-share donations are used to operate the 2-week field expedition: providing the team with food, shelter, training and transportation, as well as purchasing new project equipment and supplies. \n\nThis exciting conservation expedition begins and ends in Quito, Ecuador. \n\nContact Dr. Dusti Becker, dustizuni@yahoo.com, for further details and to obtain a Life Net Nature volunteer application form. \n\nQualifications: Experience with banding and mist-netting are desirable, but not required. We provide training. Students and recent graduates will benefit from this great resume building experience. Professionals and retirees in field biology, will enjoy the \"field camp\" experience and are much appreciated for their co-mentoring and experiences they share. All participants have the option of using the > 20 year project database for research publications, undergraduate projects, or graduate degrees.  \n\nVisit https://lastangaras.wordpress.com/who-are-we/ for more details about Life Net Nature and Reserva Las Tangaras.  \n\nTo apply: Email Dr. Dusti Becker a brief cover e-mail detailing your experience and interest in participating on a given team. Send to dustizuni@yahoo.com. (Resume optional and helpful).  Dr. Becker will send you an official Life Net Nature volunteer application form.  \n\n   Contact\nDr. Dusti Becker\n5205076685\ndustizuni@yahoo.com (preferred contact method)",
