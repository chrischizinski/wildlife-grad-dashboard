This position is responsible for the fellow’s overall experience and professional development as early career young adults in the environmental conservation field. A successful program will coordinate and schedule professional development sessions using subject matter experts to train the Leopold Fellows in the seven core areas. The Fellowship Program Coordinator will develop Leopold Fellows’ personal and professional growth and career connections. In addition to coordinating the Fellowship Program, this position will be responsible for assisting with the advancement of the Land Ethic Leader curriculum, an online, asynchronous training program currently in development and provide logistical support for other foundation programs (e.g., guided tours, visitor services, and crane programming) as needed.\n\nFuture Leaders Fellowship Program\nLeadership in conservation is a critical piece to solving the ongoing and emerging environmental issues of today. The Aldo Leopold Foundation’s Future Leaders Fellowship Program is designed for individuals who have recently completed a college degree or have equivalent combination of education, training, and work experience. Fellows will gain experience and grow in seven core areas: professionalism and ethics, conservation leadership, strategic planning, education and interpretation, marketing and communications, philanthropy, applied science and natural history, and socioecology. Each of these areas is addressed through a professional development series and applied on-the-job experiences that allow for exploration of each topic and time for each Leopold Fellow to practice and apply these key elements of leadership.\n\nLeopold Fellows will specialize in either Communications or Land Stewardship. Fellows get exposure to both program areas through either independent projects and/or other organizational efforts. Fellows also have the opportunity to interact with both a diverse range of conservation professionals and the Leopold community, including Leopold family members.\n\nFellowship Program Coordinator Position Impact Statement\nThe tradition of cultivating conservation leaders at the Aldo Leopold Foundation traces back to Aldo Leopold himself, whose mentorship of graduate students and his own children helped shape generations of environmental thinkers and practitioners. Today, this legacy continues through the Future Leaders Fellowship Program. As the Fellowship Program Coordinator, you play a central role in nurturing the next generation of conservation leaders by designing experiences that introduce, strengthen, and cultivate essential professional competencies—while also fostering the ethical awareness and relational perspective foundational to a contemporary land ethic.\n\nThis position creates opportunities for fellows to work alongside a community of practitioners, scholars, and mentors across the conservation field, allowing them to see how ethical decision-making, community engagement, and ecological responsibility play out in practice. We anticipate that program alumni will go on to lead in nonprofits, government agencies, universities, and private organizations.

The successful applicant will begin in the Fall 2026 semester.\n\nRio Grande cutthroat trout (RGCT) are the southernmost species of cutthroat trout and have experienced a severe decline in both range and abundance, now occupying only ~12 percent of its historical distribution and requires targeted management interventions to support recovery. Major components of the recovery plan detail the need to secure extant populations and reintroduce individuals within their native range in Colorado and New Mexico. Recent efforts to date include development of a multi-source, genetically diverse broodstock for the Rio Grande basin that is used for reintroduction efforts.\n\nIndividuals from this multi-source broodstock were stocked at multiple sites throughout the recently restored Rio Costilla watershed which represents one of the largest native fish restoration projects in the country. While recent research has shown that this composite broodstock is more genetically diverse compared to using single source populations there is a need to evaluate how these fish are performing in the wild. The present project has a number of goals:\n\n          1. Evaluate genetic structure and diversity of reintroduced Rio Costilla RGCT populations\n                     a.

Red Shiner are a persistent and ecologically detrimental invasive species, negatively impacting aquatic ecosystems throughout the West. Control of invasive Red Shiner populations is widely ineffective utilizing existing management tools. Therefore, alternative management strategies are necessary, such as skewing invasive population sex ratios towards all males through YY fish releases. The aim of this project is to determine the efficacy of YY Red Shiner releases by incorporating dispersal capabilities and population structure into management-ready models. \n Position Duties: The goals of this project are to: \n\n1.      Conduct mark-recapture methods and population structure admixture analysis to estimate dispersal potential and interconnectivity of the Verde River, AZ and Virgin  \n          River, NV Red Shiner populations, respectively. \n2.      Develop YY release simulations to assess the feasibility of eradicating invasive Red Shiner populations \n\nThis position will entail extensive field work and coordination with multiple state and federal biologists to sample the Verde River, AZ and Virgin River, NV. The student will deploy PIT tag arrays, conduct Red Shiner population estimates, and collect DNA samples in remote and inhospitable field locations. The student will lead a population admixture analysis utilizing DNA samples. Ultimately, the student will incorporate their data into simulations of YY Red Shiner releases to inform management on the scale of effectiveness for YY Red Shiner release scenarios. The student will author manuscripts and present at conferences to disseminate findings. The student will develop highly applicable skills for future careers in fisheries, genetics, ecology, and natural resource management, and will obtain mentoring experience by supervising undergraduate research technicians. The partners and sponsors for this project are an excellent team of scientists from federal and state agencies. The selected student will be advised by Dr. Chad Teal (U.S. Geological Survey, Utah State University) in the Technical and Experimental Aquatics Lab. In addition to these research duties, the student will need to successfully complete the required coursework, author and defend a dissertation, and graduate with their PhD within 5 years of starting. \n\nQualifications: M.S. in fisheries, ecology, quantitative methods, natural resource management, or other related fields with a minimum 3.2 GPA. A good work ethic is mandatory. Experience in leading field work is preferred. Writing, organizational, data management skills, and quantitative skills are required, as well as the ability to maintain positive working relationships with members of the lab, department, and stakeholder groups.

The Dryland Ecosystem Ecology Lab is a new research group focused on understanding how global change reshapes dryland ecosystem structure and function across spatial scales.\n This project investigates how global change–driven shifts in vegetation structure, biological soil crust cover, and sediment retention lead to non-linear changes in nutrient and carbon loss and spatial redistribution across dryland landscapes. The successful candidate will study how ecosystem state transitions influence nitrogen and carbon cycling across scales. The research will integrate multiple approaches and disciplines, including biogeochemistry, ecosystem ecology, soil science, plant and biological soil crust physiology, and microbial ecology. The student will gain experience using a range of field and laboratory techniques. Following initial project development, the PhD student will have flexibility to design an independent research program aligned with the broader goal of understanding dryland ecosystem responses to global change. The student will receive close mentorship while developing independence as a researcher.\n Fieldwork will occur in dryland ecosystems in the southwestern United States.\n Funding and Support\nThe position includes five years of guaranteed support (including summers) through a combination of research and teaching assistantships, along with a full tuition waiver. Current assistantship stipend information is available at: https://grad.wisc.edu/funding/graduate-assistantships/\n Timeline\nThe selected candidate will begin as a research technician conducting fieldwork in August 2026 and will transition into the PhD program starting January 2027.\n Qualifications\nApplicants should have experience in research, fieldwork, and/or laboratory work.

The project offers a unique opportunity to work at the interface of forest management, wildlife conservation, and landscape ecology, helping to develop management strategies that support high-quality marten habitat while maintaining key ecosystem services—including productive and economically viable timber harvest. The research is designed to produce outcomes that are directly relevant to land managers and conservation partners.\n\n \n\nPhD Position 1: \n\nThe student’s dissertation will involve: (1) non-invasively monitoring of American marten populations to assess distribution, population size and vital rates; (2) live-capture individual martens to deploy GPS collars for habitat, space use and movement data and (3) analyze movement and demographic data simultaneously to estimate individual-to-population level responses of martens to forest management practices. This position will be advised by Dr. Jonathan Pauli (https://pauli.russell.wisc.edu/).  \n\n \n\nPhD Position 2: \n\nThe student’s dissertation will involve:  (1) synthesizing ecological and remotely sensed data from the National Ecological Observation Network (NEON) to characterize forest structure, productivity, and disturbance; (2) quantifying habitat attributes important to martens, such as coarse woody debris, canopy complexity, and multi-layered forest structure and (3) evaluating trade-offs between habitat suitability (e.g., landscape connectivity and movement corridors) and forest management objectives across spatial scales. This position will be co-advised by Dr. Jonathan Pauli (https://pauli.russell.wisc.edu/) and Amy Trowbridge (https://forestandwildlifeecology.wisc.edu/people/faculty-and-staff/trowbridge-amy/)\n\n \n\nBoth students will be enrolled in the Wildlife Ecology Ph.D. program housed in the Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and will collaborate closely with partners at the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to improve habitat quality and enhance population connectivity for Wisconsin’s endangered American marten on national forest lands.\n\n \n\nQualifications: Applicants should hold a M.S. degree in ecology, wildlife, forestry, conservation, or other related discipline, though students with a B.S. degree and substantial, relevant experience are also encouraged to apply. Successful candidates will have a solid foundation in terrestrial ecology, field research, and quantitative or statistical methods. Experience with mammal trapping and handling, remote sensing, GIS, or spatial ecological data is a plus. Because this project is highly collaborative, we are especially interested in students who have worked with natural resource agencies or applied conservation partners. Prior experience with scientific writing is preferred and strong English writing and communication skills are essential. We especially welcome applications from students enrolled in federally recognized Tribes or who have experience working with Indigenous communities.\n\n \n\nSalary: Both positions are four-year funded projects that include a competitive annual stipend ($37,414), plus tuition remission and health care benefits. \n\n \n\nStart Date: Fall semester of 2026 (both positions)\n\nReview of applicants will begin on March 1st, 2026, but the position will remain open until a suitable candidate is found.\n\nTo apply: Please submit your application here: https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4NtwDNs7IGErPoi \n\nSubmitting an application includes filling out a small survey and takes approximately 15 minutes. It requires contact information for three references, and to upload in PDF format:\n\n- uploading a cover letter summarizing research interests and experiences \n\n- a Curriculum Vitae\n\n- unofficial transcripts (both undergraduate and graduate, compiled into one file)\n\nAfter reviewing all applicants, we will ask for reference letters from top candidates. Finalists will be notified and instructed to submit a formal application, including reference letters, to the UW-Madison Graduate School.\n\n \n\nUW-Madison is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer.

Our research program focuses on understanding how plants perceive and adapt to adverse environmental conditions, with the ultimate goal of protecting crops and mitigating damage caused by environmental stress.\n\nTomato will be used as the primary research model, as it is both one of the most important vegetable crops worldwide and an excellent model plant for environmental science research. Students will grow tomato plants in our greenhouse, harvest fruits at the mature green stage, and store them under different temperature conditions to investigate the effects of heat stress on fruit ripening.\n\nProject 1: Stable Carbon Isotope Fractionation and Fruit Respiration\nOne student will focus on developing a novel approach using stable carbon isotope fractionation to monitor the effects of heat stress on fruit respiration pathways, which are closely linked to fruit productivity. Although stable isotope fractionation is widely used in geochemistry, it has rarely been applied to the study of fruit ripening. This approach will provide a multidimensional perspective on how heat stress influences fruit respiratory metabolism. This project includes a collaboration with Rice University, where the student will spend approximately one week each year conducting specialized isotope measurements.\n\nProject 2: Role of Abscisic Acid (ABA) in Heat Stress Tolerance\nThe second student will investigate the role of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) in tomato plant development and fruit ripening, with a particular focus on its involvement in heat stress responses and resistance mechanisms. This project will compare wild-type tomatoes with mutant lines that have reduced or enhanced ABA accumulation in fruits, with the goal of understanding how ABA influences fruit survival under heat stress conditions.\n\nThrough two years of research training, students will gain a strong foundation in the concepts and techniques of environmental stress research, develop proficiency with relevant laboratory and greenhouse instrumentation, and acquire skills essential for careers in environmental science research, agricultural chemistry, and environmental monitoring.\n\nFunding and Qualifications\nProspective students with an interest in agricultural chemistry are encouraged to apply. Students will be supported as teaching assistants, receiving a $15,000 annual stipend and $7,000 in tuition remission, distributed equally across the three academic terms.\n\nApplicants should have a bachelor’s degree in chemistry, biology, agriculture, environmental science, or a related discipline, along with strong written and verbal communication skills and the ability to work both independently and as part of a research team.\n\nApplication Process\nApplications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, with the position closing on March 31, 2026.

Hares have been studied for >40 years on-site, and this new work will investigate the role of food and vegetative structure on hare behavioural repertoires in the context of their 10-year population cycles. Hares live on a fine edge between risk of predation/starvation vs. sustainable nutrition, setting the stage for critical behavioural tradeoffs though space and time. Using archived as well as new GPS telemetry and accelerometry data, combined with assays of structural cover and food availability/quality from remote sensing, the project will address some of the following questions: 1) Whether hares adjust movements and feeding behaviours in response to variation in food and cover, and 2) If hare responses are fine-tuned according to cyclic population dynamics and corresponding variation in predation risk and conspecific density. It is uncertain how hares survive on low-quality woody browse and limited shrub cover during winter, setting the stage for using hyperspectral imaging and LiDAR to help develop: 3) Maps of hare nutritional/structural cover landscapes through space and time, and 4) Relating hare behaviours to these complex, variable environments. Additional remote sensing using ground penetrating radar (GPR) can further support these efforts by: 5) Addressing the role of local snow conditions (depth, hardness) on food/cover availability, and corresponding hare responses through the winter season. Data resulting from such research could support dynamic models exploring how hares respond to environmental variation under climate change.

Using an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with LiDAR, multispectral, and RGB sensors, and combined with archived satellite data for the region, the PhD student may investigate some of the following questions: 1) Patterns of forest productivity, regeneration, and phenology across space and time, and 2) Sources of forest structural heterogeneity and resilience to insect outbreaks or fire. A high priority is to understand how the boreal forest may be impacted by climate change, which can be accomplished by: 3) Combining and back-casting remote sensing products to predict past changes to forest structural cover and deciduous vegetation composition (shrubification). Likewise, we are interested in understanding how variable snow conditions may affect winter forest dynamics and ecology of terrestrial mammals by: 4) Using ground penetrating radar and LiDAR to identify the determinants of local snow conditions (hardness, density).

Assistantship – Raven Movement Ecology in Prairie Canada\nDr. Adam Janke & Dr. Gunnar Kramer – Iowa State University\nDr. Jay VonBank, Dr. Todd Arnold, Dr. Frank Rohwer & Jacob Bushaw – Delta Waterfowl Foundation\n PROJECT BACKGROUND\nDelta Waterfowl, in collaboration with Iowa State University (ISU), is recruiting a highly motivated M.S. student to investigate the movement ecology of common ravens and their role in waterfowl nest depredation within the prairie/parkland ecosystems of Saskatchewan, Canada. Ravens represent a relatively new and increasingly abundant nest predator in this region, and their expanding distribution poses emerging challenges for waterfowl reproductive success.\n This research will focus on quantifying spatial and temporal movement patterns of ravens using advanced GPS telemetry. The student will investigate how raven movement strategies, habitat-use dynamics, and associated behaviors contribute to waterfowl nest depredation. Results from this work will directly inform predator management strategies to enhance conservation planning for waterfowl populations within the northern Prairie Pothole Region. The selected candidate will collaborate closely with scientists from Delta Waterfowl and Iowa State University. Field operations will begin in April 2026 in Saskatchewan, and the graduate assistantship will formally begin at Iowa State University, Ames, IA, in August 2026.\n The assistantship is supported by a combination of teaching and research assistantships that provides a $28,800 per year stipend, health insurance, and a 75% tuition waiver.\n REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS \n• B.S. in ecology, wildlife biology, wildlife management, or a related discipline \n• Eligibility for admission to Iowa State University (including a GPA >3.0)\n• Demonstrated commitment to high-quality, collaborative scientific research\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS \n• Prior experience in movement ecology, avian ecology, or waterfowl nesting ecology \n• Experience with avian capture, safe handling procedures, or deployment of tracking transmitters \n• Ability to identify waterfowl species, particularly breeding hens \n• Proficiency in data management, statistical analysis, and movement-modeling frameworks \n• Strong interpersonal skills, with demonstrated ability to work independently and lead field crews under challenging conditions\n\nAPPLICATION DEADLINE: March 1, 2026 (applications will be reviewed as they are received)\nTo apply, please submit application materials (CV with contact information for 3 professional references, unofficial transcripts, and a cover letter describing career goals and professional interests) to https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2esiV8HjWy7oS3eF9SkcsbqDyMR12WYAkJQx4OOFVvBTeMA/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=106907810723402985289. \n For additional information contact:\nDr. Gunnar Kramer: grk@iastate.edu\nDr. Adam Janke: ajanke@iastate.edu\nDr. Jay VonBank: jvonbank@deltawaterfowl.org\n\nContact\nJay VonBank\njvonbank@deltawaterfowl.org (preferred contact method)",

Gerber (https://bgerber123.github.io/) at the Colorado Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and wildlife researchers at Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The graduate research assistantship will cover university tuition, fees, health coverage, and includes a pre-tax monthly pay of $3000/month. The position is expected to start Fall 2026 and be funded through December 2028.\n\nStudy Context: Sex and age class are important demographic parameters used in population modeling, in which the results help guide management decisions and annual harvest quotas of large mammals (e.g., elk, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, mule deer). This work will help develop new methodology and workflows that will aid Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s objective of producing robust empirical demographic data and population estimates for harvested wildlife. \n\nFocus: The focus of this study will be to collect data on the size distribution of elk sex and age classes (cow, calf, bull) to train and test a predictive approach using AI algorithms (developed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife) to classify animals from high-resolution aerial imagery. Field observations and size measurements (via 3D camera) will be collected to help test the accuracy of AI predictions. An additional avenue of exploration may be data collection and AI classification of sex/age class from camera trap images. The student will be expected to develop a project proposal outlining study objectives in coordination with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and a graduate committee at Colorado State University. The student will focus on technological and software workflows to meet study objectives, however, there will likely be field work opportunities as well (e.g., field observations, drone/aerial surveys). Given the trajectory of the wildlife field, the skills gained in this study will likely be desirable for future employers. \n\n Preferred Qualifications: \n\n-          Ungulate field research experience in the intermountain west\n-          Clear interest or experience developing data analysis workflows\n-          Clear interest or experience advancing technological innovation (hardware/software) in wildlife science\n-          Experience deploying camera traps and managing large data sets\n-          Experience with AI algorithms, for example MegaDetector or SpeciesNet\n \nMinimum Qualifications:\n-          A Bachelor of Science degree in wildlife ecology, biology, natural resource management, or related field\n-          A year or more of wildlife related professional research/work experience\n-          Strong writing skills\n-          Strong work ethic \n-          Desire to collaborate with state wildlife management agencies\n\nTo be considered, please send the following materials via email with “AI/Elk Application” as the subject line to Dr. Brian D. Gerber (brian.gerber@colostate.edu) by March 2, 2026: 1) Cover letter outlining career goals, academic interests, and relevant experience related to the minimum and preferred qualifications, 2) resume with contact information for 3-4 personal references, and unofficial copy of B.S. transcripts. \n\nContact\nBrian D.

Green Sunfish is one of the fastest expanding invaders in the Southwest and are among the most invasive fish species due to their negative impacts on native fish communities. Management of invasive Green Sunfish populations requires highly intensive efforts and traditional removal techniques are seldomly effective. Therefore, alternative management strategies are necessary, such as skewing invasive population sex ratios towards all males through YY fish releases. This project will assess the feasibility of producing YY Green Sunfish by: \n\n1)     Investigating Green Sunfish genomes to uncover the sex determination system of this species and develop effective genetic sex ID markers. \n2)     Examining the effects of various environmental factors on the sex ratios of laboratory-reared Green Sunfish cohorts. \n\nPosition Duties: This position entails field work (collecting broodstock and DNA from invasive populations), hatchery management (conducting heat and rearing density experiments), and lab work (DNA extractions, bioinformatic analyses, and sex ID marker development). The student will author manuscripts and present at conferences to disseminate findings. The student will develop highly applicable skills for future careers in fisheries, genetics, aquaculture, and natural resource management, and will obtain mentoring experience by supervising undergraduate research technicians. The partners and sponsors for this project are an excellent team of scientists from federal and state agencies. The selected student will be advised by Dr. Chad Teal (U.S. Geological Survey, Utah State University) in the Technical and Experimental Aquatics Lab. In addition to these research duties, the student will need to successfully complete the required coursework, author and defend a thesis, and graduate with their M.S. within 2.5 years of starting. \n\nQualifications: Bachelor of Science in genetics, aquaculture, fisheries, ecology, natural resource management, or other related fields with a minimum 3.0 GPA (last 60 credits). A good work ethic is mandatory. Preference will be given to candidates that have research experience. Experience working in a variety of settings is preferred. Writing, organizational, data management skills, and quantitative skills are required, as well as the ability to maintain positive working relationships with members of the lab, department, and stakeholder groups. Only applicants that can obtain a valid U.S. driver’s license by start date need apply. Utah State University does not discriminate or tolerate discrimination, including harassment, based on race, religion, sex, national origin, age, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, status as a protected veteran, or any other status protected by University policy, Title IX, or any other federal, state, or local law \n\nLocation: The successful applicant will be based out of the Department of Wildland Resources at Utah State University in Logan, UT.

Opportunity: Riparian restoration tools in working grasslands\nThe Genomics, Ecology, and Modeling for Conservation Lab at North Dakota State University, led by Travis Seaborn, is recruiting for one M.S. position to join our team working on a recently funded project in collaboration with the Albert K. Ekre Grassland Preserve. For more information on the preserve see: https://ndsufoundation.com/magazine/2021/09/ekre-grassland-preserve. \n Anticipated start date: Summer 2026. Stiped ~$25,000 for 2-3 years. Tuition waiver also provided.\n The overall project will advance our ability to understand community responses to riparian restoration. Riparian ecosystems in the Northern Great Plains have been heavily altered by anthropogenic activities. Although there are numerous restoration options for riparian ecosystems, a common and effective restoration practice, in particular in incised stream systems, are beaver dam analogs. Using streams at the Ekre Grassland Preserve and nearby public land, we will be looking to do a restoration project using invasive buckthorn woody materials. To achieve this, we are beginning to plan a Before-After-Control-Impact design to assess riparian and floodplain ecosystem responses, including geomorphology, biological community, and water quality. Much of the beaver dam analog research that has been done has occurred in the western United States, and response to these activities in the Northern Great Plains is unknown. Surveys of the biological community may include electrofishing and minnow trapping for fish, camera traps for mammals, visual and auditory surveys for birds, and plant identification along transects.\n The primary goals of this position include:\n1.    Identify the impact of beaver dam analogs.\n2.    Using geographic information systems, develop beaver species distribution models for the region.\n To apply: Please email travis.seaborn@ndsu.edu a letter of interest, which should include an explanation of fit and past relevant experience, and CV by February 20th.\nContact\nTravis Seaborn\n2537973130\ntravis.seaborn@ndsu.edu (preferred contact method)",

The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: Many crop species have relatives that have also been domesticated, with selection independently being applied in the various species to modify traits such as seed size, dormancy, reduction of seed dispersal, changes in taste or toxic compounds, or changes in photoperiod sensitivity or plant architecture. Within the legume family, more than two dozen species have been domesticated, including plants such as pea, soybean, peanut, and common bean. The many related but independently domesticated species offer an opportunity to determine in which cases the domestications have occurred through modification of genetically corresponding (orthologous) genes, or via distinct, non-corresponding loci. This project will use a combination of analyses utilizing gene families, synteny relationships, genetic association results, and published gene functional information, to catalog and evaluate the genes involved in domestication in crops within the legume plant family. This research has applied value, through identification of genes that are likely to modify important domestication-related traits across many species. The research also addresses basic questions, such as whether domestication has preferentially operated on genes that have unusually high amounts of standing variation within wild populations.\n\nUnder the guidance of a mentor, this opportunity will involve: developing and applying methods in computational biology and artificial intelligence to gather information about gene function in the legume family; using the results to identify gene correspondences at several taxonomic levels – in particular, across genera, typically spanning several species of agronomic importance such as beans or chickpeas and also across the plant family as a whole; and to identify correspondences among agronomically important genes across many crop and model species in this large plant family. After identifying corresponding genes, genomic regions will be evaluated for features such as signatures of selection or diversifying or purifying selection, around genes and regions of agricultural importance.\n\nLearning Objectives: The participant will learn and apply methods in computational biology, genetics, and artificial intelligence, including statistical methods of marker-trait association, methods for determining syntenic relationships and for calculating and representing pan-genome relationships, methods for inferring gene families, and methods for inferring evolutionary events from large collections of gene families. The participant will also have the opportunity to read, evaluate, and participate in writing scientific manuscripts in these areas of focus.\n\nMentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Steven Cannon (Steven.Cannon@usda.gov).

ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: Stressors that negatively affect honey bee health (e.g., agrichemicals, intracellular pathogens) are common in the beekeeping industry. These stressors act on cellular and molecular processes, but unlike in human and veterinary medicine, cell culture systems are largely underutilized in honey bee and other bee research to study the effects of stressors at a high level of resolution under controlled conditions. Although a continuous honey bee cell line exists, it is persistently infected with a honey bee virus. As an ORISE Postdoctoral Research Fellow, you will collaborate with a team of colleagues led by your mentor to establish virus-free primary cultures using tissues from bee pollinators of commercial importance, as well as from the mite, Varroa destructor, a widespread, often abundant parasite known to transmit honey bee viruses. Reproducible establishment of primary bee and mite parasite cultures will provide a powerful platform for cell-based studies examining host-pathogen and bee-agrichemical interactions and promote creation of innovations that mitigate negative outcomes from these relationships.\n\nLearning Objectives: You will learn and apply skills in microbiology, virology, insect biology and beekeeping to explore host-virus interactions at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels and transfer this knowledge to impact the beekeeping industry.\n\nMentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Michael Goblirsch (Michael.Goblirsch@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: March 1, 2026.

    "description": "USDA-ARS Fellowship in Processing Technologies to Produce High Quality Hawaiian ‘Ulu Flour\nOak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) (Private) | https://orise.orau.gov/index.html\nDetails\nPosting:\nhttps://www.zintellect.com/Opportunity/Details/USDA-ARS-PWA-2025-0208\nApplication Deadline:\n03/27/2026\nPublished:\n01/08/2026\nStarting Date:\nafter 2/1/2026\nHours per Week:\nat least 40\nSalary:\nCommensurate / Negotiable\nEducation Required:\nDoctorate\nExperience Required:\nat least 2 years\nLocation:\nHilo, Hawaii\nTags:\nFaculty / Post-Doc Appointments\nDescription\n *Applications may be reviewed on a rolling-basis.\n\nARS Office/Lab and Location: A postdoctoral research opportunity is available with the Tropical Crop and Commodity Protection Research Unit within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) located in Hilo, Hawaii.\n\nThe Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency with a mission to find solutions to agricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to table. ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nThe mission of the Tropical Crop and Commodity Protection Research Unit in Hilo, Hawaii is to develop pre and postharvest technologies and management strategies for invasive pests, and to open and maintain market access and improved quality of tropical fruit, vegetable and ornamental crops grown in the Pacific Basin. The long-term goals of our research program are to develop and protect U.S export markets for fresh tropical commodities. An emphasis is placed on expanding and diversifying agriculture and agricultural exports in Hawaii and other states by providing environmentally sound, economically viable systems, treatments, or processes that control quarantine pests, ensure product quality, and increase product value while safeguarding the agriculture of other states.\n\nResearch Project: ‘Ulu (breadfruit) has significant cultural importance to Hawaiians and is one of the original staple crops that fed the island nation for close to 1,000 years with high starch, fiber, and protein contents. ‘Ulu also has a low to moderate glycemic index when cooked and can help manage blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Today, at nearly 2,500 miles from the US mainland, Hawaii imports greater than 85% of its food. Disruption to the supply chain can have catastrophic effects as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2020, food insecurity has dramatically increased among the Islands, encouraging the expansion of stable crops and processing capabilities that support the long-term storage and distribution of processed foods derived from these staple foods.\n\nMuch of Hawaii ‘ulu supply is sold as fresh produce. Mature ‘ulu, once picked, becomes soft within 1-3 days without refrigeration; the short shelf-life reduces profit margins, generates waste, limits its distribution and export opportunities. The ‘Ulu Cooperative, a collection of small, diversified ‘ulu producers, helped develop processes to produce ‘ulu flour in 2011 to increase its potential market and maximize the yield of ‘ulu. One of the biggest hurdles, however, to the processing of many of Hawaii’s crops is the lack of industrial scale facilities. With Hawaii having the highest electricity retail price at more than double the US average, the cost of large-scale processing is prohibitive. Presently, processing of ‘ulu relies on steamers and dehydrators, which are time consuming and do not produce the most consistent quality of end products. Improved processing methods are urgently needed to overcome the bottleneck of scaling up ‘ulu production, increase market distribution, reduce waste, and foster local economies. Specific activities will include maintaining and operating food processing equipment, experimental design, and nutritional and sensory analysis. Outcomes from this project will be useful to our 'ulu growers as well as other tropical commodities that are extremely perishable and in need of better processing methods.\n\nLearning Objectives: The participant will learn how to incorporate their scientific and technical knowledge in the field of food science with food processing engineering to improve the processing capability for both research within ARS and the stakeholders in Hawaii. The participant will get to explore the possibility of incorporating sensors, spectroscopy, imaging, and machine learning techniques into the postharvest processing workflows and/or pre-harvest evaluation of food quality and safety. The participant will have the opportunity to interact with our commercial and academic collaborators, and present their research to a wide range of audiences in engineering and food science disciplines.\n\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Peishih Liang (peishih.liang@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: 2026.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full-time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. \n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS.

ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: A key objective of the Circular Economy for Reimagining Maize Agriculture (CERCA) project supported by USDA-ARS is to develop corn varieties with reduced grain protein content coupled with high yield. This will help US farmers continue to produce corn grain efficiently for animal feed and industrial uses while reducing input costs associated with nitrogen fertilizer. Rather than extracting nitrogen from soil in the form of grain, a new approach to corn agriculture is to recycle nitrogen on-farm as much as possible to improve its profitability and sustainability. One strategy to achieve this goal is to reduce fertilizer inputs and select for new varieties that primarily remobilize nitrogen from senescing leaves to roots, stalks, or cobs rather than seeds.\n\nThe participant will help evaluate three generations of selection for reduced grain protein content that were performed independently at three locations (IA, MN, and MO) and in three populations by CERCA collaborators. In 2026 samples of the three starting populations, the most recent selected generations from each location, and control unselected generations will be planted in NC and in other CERCA cooperator locations. The participant will be involved in field experiments and controlled pollinations to produce research materials. The participant will measure grain protein content on 96 individual plants within each sub-population using near-infrared reflectance spectrophotometry. Grain protein content data of each population will be compared to measure the effectiveness of individual plant selection to reduce grain protein content.\n\nThe participant will also perform low coverage sequencing of each plant and manage bioinformatics pipelines for genomic data analysis.  Protein content data will be combined with genotype data to permit two tests of functional importance of each genetic variant: genome-wide association study and signals of selection due to allele frequency shifts under selection. Candidate genes identified by these approaches will be evaluated for involvement in biosynthesis and cellular localization of storage proteins. Genes identified in this way will represent targets for future gene editing to improve the rate of genetic improvement for reduced grain protein content. \n\nLearning Objectives: The candidate will learn about genetic analysis of complex phenotypes in crops and the use of genetics to understand and manipulate grain protein content. The candidate will collaborate with the USDA ARS CERCA team. The candidate will gain experience by participating in CERCA meetings as well as ARS unit meetings.\n\nMentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is James Holland (jim.holland@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: July 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $73,944 - $82,357 annually.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS.

The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: This appointment is part of the Methods and Applications of Food Composition Laboratory effort improve the speed, accuracy, and/or sensitivity of methods for measuring nutrients in the foods Americans eat. Dietary fiber (DF) is the polymeric carbohydrate portion of plant-based foods not hydrolyzed by human digestive enzymes.  DF consumption has been linked to reduced plasma cholesterol concentration, improved glucose regulation, and decreased incidence of heart disease and colorectal cancer. Since 2005 the Dietary Guidelines for Americans have listed underconsumption of DF as a public health concern, however changes the definition of DF have resulted in a complicated and costly process for measuring DF content in foods. The goal of this project is to reduce the cost of dietary fiber analysis. The development of a simplified method for DF determination and adoption by professional organizations such as the AOAC or Cereals & Grains (formerly AACC) would benefit\n\nThe fellow will learn how to generate an instrumental method for soluble dietary fiber analysis, along with exemplar data sufficient to initiate an interlaboratory study, which is required for AOAC and AACC approval.  Samples of beans (Great Northern and black), cereal grains (whole wheat and rice), ancient grains (sorghum and spelt), pseudocereals (amaranth and buckwheat), and traditional foods with novel carbohydrate components such as algae (nori and kombu) will be commercially obtained.  Lyophilized, ground, food samples will be digested and under the biomimetic conditions of AOAC 2022.01 in tared digestion tubes, however after digestion, IDF will be isolated by centrifugation.  Bypassing precipitation, proteinaceous and mineral components will be removed from the supernatant using ion exchange resins. The supernatant will be lyophilized and reconstituted at several levels of dilution to optimize method selectivity and sensitivity. Each level will receive the internal standard, diethyleneglycol, and be analyzed by size exclusion chromatography followed by RI detection and universal mass calibration will be performed by viscometry.    As a universal detector, RI allows for absolute quantitation of soluble dietary fiber with no need for ash or nitrogen correction, saving time and reducing cost. Universal mass calibration will offer true molecular weight data for soluble fiber composition.  These data will be published in an AOAC or AACC journal, and a potential interlaboratory study.\n\nLearning Objectives: As a result of this training, the participant will gain knowledge and experience in:\n\nEnzymatic, chromatographic and related methods for the analysis of dietary fiber and other carbohydrates.\nAnalytical method validation, including assessment of analytical figures of merit, robustness, and method detection limits.\nStatistical methods used to evaluate assay variability in nutrition science.\nMentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Michael Bukowski (michael.bukowski@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: As soon as possible, or February 6, 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience.

Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: A legacy of fire exclusion and past management in our Western U.S. Forests, coupled with rapid changes in climate, have led to dramatically more frequent and large-magnitude disturbances, including massive, high-severity stand-replacing fires. The increasing scale and severity of disturbances affects forest successional trajectories and in turn presents a challenge for forest managers to meet economic and forest recovery goals. The goal of the current research project is to quantify change in forest habitat following large-scale fires in California, Oregon, and Washington to better understand where managers most need to apply fire and fuels treatments, promote future forests, and protect the remaining high-value forest refugia necessary for the persistence of key wildlife species. Currently, this project has collected data across 7 wildfires including data on stand structure and condition, understory cover and species composition, the spread of invasive plant species, and use by wildlife species. This data was collected primarily in upland habitats, but a subset of the data focuses on changes in meadows over time.\n\nLearning Objectives: The selected fellow(s) in this project will have the opportunity to contribute and advance their knowledge and skills in forest and meadow ecology, disturbance ecology and wildlife research that can inform natural resource management. The fellow(s) will interact with a variety of forests managers, and a team of research staff, including leading scientists in the fields of forestry and wildlife management. The fellow(s) will have the opportunity to enhance their communications skills via participating in various formal and informal meetings, learning new quantitative techniques, and writing of manuscripts and reports for possible publication. \n\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Angela White (angela.white2@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: February 2026.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year and ten months (22 months total) but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $4,500 - $6,500 monthly.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service.

Deschutes County, Oregon represents the northwestern-most extent of the species range and lies far outside the extant range of pinyon pine species. Extensive treatments of juniper woodlands have been expedited throughout western states for restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, sage grouse habitat, and altered fire regimes. However, we lack clear understanding of how these treatments impact PIJA populations.  \n\nManagement priorities for PIJA in Oregon include assessing impacts of juniper treatments on PIJA and determining state-wide distribution. The primary goals of this project are to experimentally study how juniper treatments impact occupancy, habitat use, and nesting of PIJA on BLM lands in Deschutes County, Oregon. We are implementing a before-after-control-impact study and use bioacoustics monitoring, point counts, and nest searching methods. The MS project will focus on at least one component of the project. This work is in partnership with the East Cascades Bird Alliance, US Fish and Wildlife, and Deschutes BLM. We also contribute to the PIJA Western Working Group and the PIJA Conservation Action Strategy (CAS). The MS candidate will be expected to coordinate with and contribute findings to larger range-wide intiatives. \n\nLOCATION & PROGRAM: This position supports a student in the Masters of Science in Natural Resources at Oregon Tech in Klamath Falls, OR.

Oregon Tech is on a quarter system. Fall, Winter, and Spring terms are 11 weeks. Our academic year runs from mid-September to Mid-June.  The GTA provides a per-term stipend and partial tuition remission during the academic year (Fall through Spring terms). In addition, this research assistantship will provide additional part-time stipend during the spring term, and full-time hourly salary over the summer. Some travel costs from Klamath Falls to Bend, OR will be covered. The graduate student will be expected to use their own vehicle, preferably one that can handle rugged, rocky roads to access field sites. If the student would prefer to forgo the GTA position and cover their own academic costs, that would be an option. \n\nPOSITION REQUIREMENTS: The candidate should have a Bachelors degree in Natural Resources, Wildlife, Ecology, Environmental Science or a closely related program of study and should meet the requirements for acceptance into the Masters of Natural Resources program at Oregon Tech. Ideally, the applicant will have at least 2 years of field experience studying birds, particularly nest searching and point counts.

The students will use Autonomous Recording Units (ARUs) and spring drumming counts to determine occupancy and abundance of Ruffed Grouse. The students will also be responsible for sampling mosquitoes for West Nile Virus. Finally, the students will collect data about other breeding birds utilizing young forests, and vegetation structure data.\n\nThis project will occur across West Virginia on private and public lands. Ruffed Grouse and bird utilizing young forests have declined precipitously, and the goal of this project is to identify landscape scale management strategies to improve populations via occupancy or abundance. Additionally, West Nile Virus could be a contributing factor in Ruffed Grouse declines, and in West Virginia there are no data about the distribution and prevalence of the virus or mosquitoes. The students will also have opportunities and flexibility to develop and design additional research projects if they are within the scope of the main project questions. Some songbird species that could respond to management include Golden-winged warbler, Prairie warbler, and Yellow-breasted chat. \n\nThe project will occur on multiple state wildlife management areas, state forests, and on Weyerhaeuser property. There will be significant traveling and potential for camping or living in rustic state field houses. The students should also have experience driving on gravel or dirt roads and with 4x4 vehicles. The data collection will begin in April and continue into August. Students should expect to be flexible with scheduling and work together to coordinate data collection schedules. Results should inform landscape level planning and management strategies for Ruffed Grouse and other young forest species. The research is funded through the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources, Ruffed Grouse Society, and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. \n\nThe student will be working towards a Ph.D. Wildlife and Fisheries Resources at West Virginia University.

Specific aspects of the study will include the construction of a user-friendly, ArcGIS online decision support tool for prioritizing areas for reforestation that will maximize co-benefits for waterfowl. The position carries an annual stipend of $20,000 plus tuition waiver. Expected start date of May or August 2026. \n Project Description: Bottomland hardwood forests are under extreme and accelerated pressure from anthropogenic and environmental stressors, subsequently impact many ecological processes including the degradation of habitat quality for forested wetland dependent waterfowl. The extent of historical loss from drainage and agricultural conversion; degradation of forest health from insects and disease; shifts in tree species composition from water stress, and excessive declines in abundance of wintering waterfowl in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley are overwhelmingly documented. Thus, restoration and reforestation effects are of utmost priority in the region and newly emerging carbon credit markets may provide the catalyst needed to accelerate reforestation in the region to improve habitat suitability for wintering mallards. The purpose of this project is to provide guidance for carbon-based reforestation efforts to maximize the co-benefits for waterfowl.   \n Requirements: Applicants must have a 2.7 overall undergraduate GPA or 3.0 GPA in the last 60 semester hours of undergraduate courses.

Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: Weather is a critical element in wildland fire, driving both fire behavior and smoke dispersion. These are issues for both wildfires and prescribed fires, and the needs for the two types of fires, and the two areas of impact, are very different. While smoke and fire behavior are traditionally studied separately, they are closely related through fire intensity, consumption, buoyancy fluxes, etc. Prescribed fires are intentionally executed to achieve specific goals, and the intent and goals lead to constraints that either don’t exist, or cannot be selected/managed during wildfires. \n\nWe are looking for a fellow to engage in research and tool development that addresses atmospheric influences on lower intensity fires, more typical of prescribed fires than wildfires. The area of research is broadly defined, allowing a significant degree of flexibility. It can include, for example: \n\nunderstanding the relationship between atmospheric model output and on-the-ground weather at the earth’s surface; \nmeasurement techniques for fire behavior, smoke lofting, turbulence, and other in situ properties; \nremote sensing of fire behavior using UAS, satellites, or acoustics; \ndevelopment of educational materials to communicate the state of fire weather science to fuel managers and fire fighters.\nRegardless of the specific focus, the research highly recommends the ability to employ the fundamental physics of fluid dynamics to develop novel statistical techniques, analyze satellite and other remote sensing data, implement machine learning algorithms, assess numerical model performance, improve risk assessment tools, and deepen our understanding of fire and smoke as ecological processes.\n\nLearning Objectives: The fellow will collaborate with leading experts in fire meteorology and smoke transport and dispersion. The fellowship provides excellent opportunities to learn about interactions between the planetary boundary layer, complex terrain, and mixing processes involved in smoke and fire. The breadth of techniques and skills used in fire/smoke-atmosphere interactions research guarantees that whatever skills the fellow starts with, there are other skills they will add to their portfolio. The team’s regular interactions with land management and air quality management practitioners provide an unparalleled opportunity to understand the application needs that drive the research questions of greatest potential impact.\n\nMentor: The mentors for this opportunity are Susan O'Neill (susan.oneill1@usda.gov), Brian Potter (brian.potter@usda.gov), and Joseph Charney (joseph.j.charney@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentors.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: January/February 2026.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be up to one year but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $70,000 - $90,000 annually.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service. Participants do not become employees of USDA, USDA Forest Service, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\n\nQuestions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process please email ORISE.USFS.PNWRS@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.\n\nQualifications\nThe qualified candidate should have received or be currently pursuing a master's degree in one of the relevant fields.\n\nPreferred skills:\n\nPrevious experience with coupled fire-atmosphere models. \nStipend\n$70,000.00 – $90,000.00 Yearly \nContact\nUSDA-FS-PNWRS-2025-0261\ncontact via the web posting is preferred (see Details section)",

    "description": "2026 Summer: LTER Plant Community Ecology Internships and REUs\nCedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve (State) | https://cedarcreek.umn.edu/\nDetails\nPosting:\nhttp://z.umn.edu/cdrjobs\nApplication Deadline:\n03/01/2026\nPublished:\n11/24/2025\nStarting Date:\nbetween 6/1/2026 and 6/15/2026\nEnding Date:\nbetween 8/14/2026 and 9/4/2026\nHours per Week:\n40\nSalary:\n$15.50 per hour\nEducation Required:\nHigh School Diploma\nExperience Required:\nnone\nLocation:\n2660 Fawn Lake Drive NE (East Bethel, Minnesota)\nTags:\nUndergraduate Opportunities\nDescription\n Position Overview:\nThe Cedar Creek LTER (Long Term Ecological Research Network) has several opportunities for students to work as plant community ecology interns. Most positions run from June through August, but some interns are needed as early as March, and some are needed through October. Your educational institution may be able to approve this internship for any field biology requirement of your major. As a research intern, you will contribute to ongoing field experiments, attend scientific seminars, and interact with professors, post-docs, and graduate students. If you are an undergraduate or a newly graduated student with a background or interest in biology, ecology, environmental science, botany, environmental education, or related field we encourage you to apply.\n\nPay is $15.50 per hour. Typical workdays are eight hours Monday through Friday; however, some projects require weekend, early morning, and evening work. Most of the work you do will be out in the field, though a few jobs have indoor laboratory or computer components. On-site dormitory housing is available to rent.\n\nResearch Overview:\nWe have two large scale projects, a new experiment, and several other LTER projects sampling across experimental platforms that interns will be working on for the season. BioCON is one of the large-scale experiments where we explore the ways in which plant communities respond to environmental changes such as increased nitrogen deposition, increased atmospheric CO2, decreased biodiversity, altered precipitation patterns, and increased temperatures. Another large-scale project is the Big Biodiversity experiment that studies how plant biodiversity affects the rates, dynamics, and stability of ecological processes at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. The new WEM experiment will be set up during the field season and will be looking at changes in precipitation, species establishment, and removal of certain consumer groups. Throughout the summer we will maintain and sample these experiments. \n\nProfessional Development Opportunities:\nAs part of these positions, you may have the opportunity to work with researchers in a more in depth manner regarding experimental processes. There will also be an opening research symposium as well as seminars led by researchers on a variety of topics during the summer. \n\nREU (Research Experience for Undergrads) Opportunities\nCedar Creek LTER also has multiple REU opportunities for the summer. These opportunities are open to undergraduate students that have not yet graduated (enrolled for fall 2026 classes). The pay rate is in stipend form and is comparable to the internship pay rate. These REU positions will focus on sampling across the LTER experimental platforms at Cedar Creek. \n\n\nResearch site:\nCCESR is an eight square mile tract of land 35 miles north of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul (MN). Cedar Creek is endowed with a mosaic of prairie, savanna, sedge meadows, bogs, open water, forests, and even abandoned agricultural fields. Its large size, great natural biodiversity, and uniform soil substrate make it ideal for ecosystem studies. \n\n\nQualifications:\n\nAbility to work outdoors.\nEffective analytical and communication skills.\nStrong organizational and time management skills.\nEnd date must be later than August 14th.\nDriver’s license is preferred but not required.\n\nTo apply for the intern position please visit our website, z.umn.edu/cdrjobs. The deadline for application submission is February 17th. For those interested in a spring position, please apply by February 9th. For any questions regarding the internships or application please email ccintern@umn.edu or call 612-301-2616. \n\n\n\nContact\nTroy Mielke\n6123012616\nccintern@umn.edu (preferred contact method)",

One of those openings will be devoted to assisting with the long-term monitoring of forest insects present in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF). \n\nStudents will work with research teams involving other undergraduate and graduate students, studying the biota and ecology of HBEF. The REU students will develop and conduct an independent research project under the supervision of their mentor. Many REU students continue their work as an independent study or senior honors thesis at their home institution. Additionally, through weekly on-site presentations given by the mentors and other scientists, students are also exposed to a full spectrum of ecosystem research at Hubbard Brook. The program runs from late May to mid-August. Students receive a stipend of $5500 for the 10-week program, as well as housing. Limited funding is available for research supplies and travel expenses. Students live at HBRF’s researcher housing adjacent to HBEF, among a community of summer field students and technicians. All residents are expected to share and cooperate with cleaning, cooking, and related chores.\n Lepidoptera / Forest insect community: This project aims to understand more about the Lepidoptera (moths and caterpillars) community, the most important herbivores in northern hardwood forests and a critical link from plant production to consumers like birds and bats. We will work with the insect-REU student to develop a project that may include elements such as building a photographic library of the moths and caterpillars within Hubbard Brook, collecting forest insect samples using various field methods, developing both manual and AI-assisted methods for identifying and enumerating moths (and other insect orders), as well as other research avenues to be determined by the student and mentors. Due to the Lepidoptera and forest insect work being closely linked to bird and bat research, the student will learn and participate in long-term bird research including nest searching and counting food availability, as well as participate in bat research and bioacoustics monitoring. Through this opportunity, the student will have ample access to a multitude of research questions to explore and a chance to contribute to new knowledge in forest ecosystem dynamics.\n In your application, please include: a letter explaining why a summer research project interests you and how it fits into your broader plans, your resume and email contact for two references (they do not need to submit letters). Applications are due by March 6.\n\nIf interested in the position, please send your application to Dr. Matt Ayres (Dartmouth College: matthew.p.ayres@dartmouth.edu) and Jessica Jones (Dartmouth College: jessica.s.jones.gr@dartmouth.edu). \n\nContact\nJessica Jones\njessica.s.jones.gr@dartmouth.edu (preferred contact method)",

The postdoc will work closely with a team of internal and external research partners to develop a series of research questions that can be addressed using existing transmitter and band encounter data. Initial research objectives may include but are not limited to quantifying air space use, identifying major movement coordinators, assessing local/relocation movement behaviors around existing wind energy infrastructure, evaluating the effects of wind energy infrastructure on habitat selection and displacement of winter distributions. A predictive approach could use species distribution modeling coupled with dynamic landscape models or process-explicit models to simulate land-use change or disturbance to forecast shifts or displacement from preferred habitats. \n The postdoc will be expected to lead the design of a series of new projects that could incorporate multi-species transmitter deployments and/or field-based drone surveys. We anticipate opportunity to evaluate the direct effects of infrastructure development by designing a before-after-controlled impact study, and developing predictive models aimed to guide best management practices for sitting future wind development projects. This position carries an annual salary of $65,000-$70,000 plus retirement and health benefits. Expected start date flexible, but as early as immediately. \n Requirements: Applicants must have a PhD in ecology, wildlife sciences, geospatial sciences, landscape ecology, or a related field of study. The desired candidate will have knowledge and enthusiasm for waterfowl and experience with GPS transmitter data, geospatial analyses, remote sensing, and statistical and ecological modeling approaches that use modern statistical packages, open access google earth engine for deep learning, and modern mapping applications.

This is a collaborative research project investigating the response of plants, birds, and soils to different cattle grazing practices on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grasslands in Kansas and Colorado. Although grazing animals such as bison historically played an important role in native prairie, grazing is currently excluded or highly limited in many CRP sites related to native prairie. Our study will quantify potential conservation risks and benefits of cattle grazing on CRP sites located in tallgrass (Kansas) and shortgrass (Colorado).\n\nThe crew lead will manage plant data collection in three-person sampling crews (two technicians and one lead). The crew will be responsible for sampling a subset of sites (36) in our areas of interest in Colorado. Reaching sites will require the team lead to drive a few hours each day over paved and low maintenance (dirt, gravel) roads in relatively remote, rural areas. Duties include but are not limited to: collecting vegetation structural data, plant species abundance, and plant biomass; data entry and quality control; and equipment preparation and maintenance. The lead technician will be responsible for compiling data at the end of each day and running code script to ensure quality and accuracy. The lead technician will also delegate tasks to technicians and themselves, along with communicating tasks and implementing protocols with the lead graduate student who will be stationed near central Kansas (Stafford or St. John). Candidates must be willing to hike long distances into field sites through short grass prairie while carrying equipment to reach sampling locations. Working hours will be spent almost exclusively in the field and involve early mornings (due to extreme heat), long hours when necessary, and maintaining motivation during variable weather conditions. The lead technician must be able to transport themselves to Wichita, KS for initial orientation, followed by transporting themselves to field housing in Colorado. The lead technician must be ready to begin training and orientation in mid-late May 2026. The field position will end by August 8th, 2026.

This is a 9 month, tenure-track position in the School of Natural Resources that is funded through a partnership between LSSU and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) titled the Partnership for Aquaculture Research and Management (PARM). The PARM position has administrative (25%), research (45%), teaching and mentoring (25%), and service (5%) responsibilities, and will be responsible for supporting aquaculture initiatives that address university and MDNR interests. The core appointment is based on a 9-month academic contract. However, due to the year-round needs of the hatchery and the PARM program, the position includes additional expectations during the winter and summer terms, and these will be compensated by an additional stipend.\nAdministrative responsibilities include, but are not limited to, providing vision for and year-round oversight of CFRE Fish Hatchery operations, developing and managing the hatchery operational budget, supervising hatchery personnel, and working with internal and external partners to ensure smooth operation of the hatchery. Research responsibilities include creating an active, externally-funded research program in aquaculture that engages students and supports LSSU and MDNR research needs, publishing research results in peer-reviewed scientific journals, presenting at professional conferences, acquiring external funding for research, and maintaining and developing collaborative relationships with state, federal, and tribal agencies. Teaching responsibilities may include teaching Freshwater Fish Culture, Internship in Aquaculture, Apprenticeship in Fish Culture, and thesis mentoring (Senior Project and MS Project). Mentoring undergraduates and graduate students engaged in research is expected.\nLSSU is a small (<2,000 undergraduate students) state university located in the beautiful Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The campus sits on the St. Marys River, the sole outflow of Lake Superior and international boundary with Canada, and provides numerous educational and professional opportunities in aquaculture, fisheries management, and aquatic ecology. Additionally, LSSU is surrounded by three Great Lakes and many state, provincial, and national forests and parks that provide tremendous recreational opportunities and a high quality of life.\nThe CFRE Fish Hatchery (https://www.lssu.edu/cfre/undergraduate-opportunities/hatchery/) houses a student-run Atlantic salmon hatchery, providing hands-on classroom opportunities. The Richard and Theresa Barch CFRE building, located adjacent to the hatchery, provides expanded research facilities, including an analytical lab and experimental mesocosms, along with a Great Lakes Discovery Center for K-12 education, all along the shores of the St. Marys River. The facility is uniquely positioned to build partnerships to advance Great Lakes education, research, and community engagement in the region. The Assistant Professor of Aquaculture position will play a key role in contributing to the growth of the CFRE and related student opportunities.\nSuccess of students within the School of Natural Resources (SNR) stems from extensive interaction with faculty during hands-on labs, student research, and active student organizations. All students within the school are required to complete senior thesis research and they are encouraged to present their research at regional and national scientific conferences. Additionally, the SNR recently created an accelerated MS (4+1) program in Fisheries and Wildlife, which enables expanded research opportunities. Faculty also work closely in advising student clubs, including the nationally recognized Fisheries and Wildlife Club (student sub-unit of the American Fisheries Society). The successful candidate will be expected to mentor students engaged in undergraduate research, and contribute to university service, including advising student organizations.\n\nMinimum Qualifications: Master’s or Doctoral degree in Aquaculture or closely related discipline appropriate to the assignment is required at the time of appointment. The successful applicant should have administrative experience and demonstrated ability or potential to conduct excellent research and mentor undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nPreferred Qualifications: Experience teaching courses in aquaculture, familiarity with aquaculture of salmonids, experience including students in research, and providing professional opportunities for students outside of class. Experience with grant writing and acquisition of external funding.\n\nPhysical Demands: Be able to accompany students on field labs, actively lead and participate in field and hatchery activities; be able to lift up to 50 pounds; possess a valid driver’s license and operate a 4WD truck.\n\nContact\nJonathan P.

The campus sits on the St. Marys River, the sole outflow of Lake Superior and international boundary with Canada, and provides numerous educational and professional opportunities in aquaculture, fisheries management, and aquatic ecology. Additionally, LSSU is surrounded by three Great Lakes and many state, provincial, and national forests and parks that provide tremendous recreational opportunities and a high quality of life.\nThe CFRE Fish Hatchery (https://www.lssu.edu/cfre/undergraduate-opportunities/hatchery/) houses a student-run Atlantic salmon hatchery, providing hands-on classroom opportunities. The Richard and Theresa Barch CFRE building, located adjacent to the hatchery, provides expanded research facilities, including an analytical lab and experimental mesocosms, along with a Great Lakes Discovery Center for K-12 education, all along the shores of the St. Marys River. The facility is uniquely positioned to build partnerships to advance Great Lakes education, research, and community engagement in the region. The Assistant Professor of Aquaculture position will play a key role in contributing to the growth of the CFRE and related student opportunities.\nSuccess of students within the School of Natural Resources (SNR) stems from extensive interaction with faculty during hands-on labs, student research, and active student organizations. All students within the school are required to complete senior thesis research and they are encouraged to present their research at regional and national scientific conferences. Additionally, the SNR recently created an accelerated MS (4+1) program in Fisheries and Wildlife, which enables expanded research opportunities. Faculty also work closely in advising student clubs, including the nationally recognized Fisheries and Wildlife Club (student sub-unit of the American Fisheries Society). The successful candidate will be expected to mentor students engaged in undergraduate research, and contribute to university service, including advising student organizations.\n\nMinimum Qualifications: Master’s or Doctoral degree in Aquaculture or closely related discipline appropriate to the assignment is required at the time of appointment. The successful applicant should have administrative experience and demonstrated ability or potential to conduct excellent research and mentor undergraduate and graduate students.",

Magnolia is pioneering a new era in environmental stewardship by leveraging compliance-based markets to drive large-scale, impactful conservation and restoration efforts. Project developers such as energy companies and public entities purchase mitigation from Magnolia to maintain compliance with the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, and other federal or state\nregulations. To date, we have conserved nearly 30,000 acres (and counting!) of critical habitat for dozens of rare and endangered species nationwide, the majority of which have been endangered bird and bat mitigation projects for wind and solar developers. Alongside species mitigation, Magnolia has established flourishing markets for wetland mitigation throughout the Midwest. We are growing quickly and are looking to identify talented and inspired people to join our multidisciplinary team. Learn more at www.mitigation.org.\n\nResponsibilities: As an Environmental Market Analyst at Magnolia, you will have the opportunity to\njoin one of the company’s core teams and work alongside the people at the vanguard of compliancebased environmental conservation. Our teams collaborate closely, so you will likely work on projects and tasks across different areas of the company. Working at a small start-up, Magnolia’s Environmental Market Analysts will contribute directly to the creation of real-world conservation projects around the country.\n\n1) Land Team: The Land Team is charged with finding, assessing, and acquiring potential conservation sites using a variety of methods including, but not limited to, geospatial analysis, on-site assessments, in-person meetings, and real estate transactions. Environmental Market Analysts will assist with outreach to potential partner landowners and organizations across the United States. Day-to-day tasks include species data analysis, GIS mapping, and drafting conservation documents. Experience with GIS software, technical reading/writing, or rural real estate are a bonus but not required.\n\n2) Regulatory Team: The Regulatory Team is responsible for working with various governmental agencies and NGOs to develop and approve new conservation projects. This team manages agency relationships, drafts regulatory filings, and maintains a deep understanding of the mechanics of each environmental market in which we operate. Day-to-day tasks include communicating with environmental agencies, drafting regulatory documents, and researching market guidelines. Experience with proposal-writing, technical reading/writing, or GIS software is a bonus but not required.\n\n3) Growth Team: The Growth Team manages relationships with mitigation buyers, exploring opportunities to provide these offsets to new companies or into new geographies. Growth Team members market and sell environmental mitigation credits to a variety of entities across the country, including large-scale renewable energy and infrastructure projects, by analyzing trends in clean energy markets, managing relationships with developers, and staying up to date with compliance-based mitigation requirements. Day-to-day tasks include market research, sales prospecting, reaching out to new clients, and drafting sales proposals. Experience in a sales role or proposal-writing is a bonus but not required.\n\nBeyond team-specific tasks, Environmental Analysts will assist with daily operations at the company, which may include some combination of the following: proposal-writing, marketing and branding, restoration ecology, data analysis, market research, and administrative tasks. Past analysts have produced valuable work that has positively impacted the trajectory of the company. This is an opportunity to leave a real impact at a mission-driven startup company that is operating in the new and growing field of environmental offsets!\n\nEligibility/Qualifications: Magnolia is searching for candidates who share our enthusiasm for entrepreneurship, conservation, and market-based environmental solutions. An ideal candidate will be intellectually curious, resourceful, proactive, and comfortable collaborating with a small team. Applicants must be students enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate degree program graduating in 2026 or 2027. Ability to work eight to ten weeks is strongly preferred.\n\nCompensation: Environmental Market Analysts will receive a base stipend of $3,000 per month, subject to increase, depending on an applicant’s need to relocate and ability to receive funding from partner academic institutions.

Help advance science about tropical montane forest bird communities. Learn how to collect data to determine community and species-level responses to deforestation, forest recovery, forest fragmentation, and landscape and climate changes. Your participation helps sustain an important protected area in the mega-diverse Choco Endemic Bird Area (EBA). \n\nCost-share volunteers/trainees assist Dr. Dusti Becker with long-term avian monitoring and conservation in the Andes at the beautiful forest protected area, Reserva las Tangaras.  In exchange volunteers receive experience-based training in mist netting and bird banding, including the use of Hall traps and practice with hummingbird banding. \n\nTeam Dates:      August 9-22, 2026 (6 positions available)\n\n                             December 7-20, 2026 (2 positions available)\n\nWhere:  Reserva Las Tangaras, a 130-acre nature preserve, boasts more than 25 species of hummingbirds, dozens of colorful tanagers, the largest regional Andean cock-of-the-rock display lek, along with over 300 tropical bird species, many of which are Choco and Andean endemics. During the expedition, LNN teams typically detect around 175 - 200 different species of birds in the reserve and study area. Team members always see additional bird species while traveling to and from the project site. The reserve is also home to endangered capuchin monkeys, spectacled bears, cougars, and myriads of other wildlife species, including several rare and endangered rain frogs. \n\nActivities: Volunteers are trained (or refreshed on) setting up and monitoring mist nets, extracting birds from nets, carrying birds from nets to banding stations, and recording ornithological and ecological data in the field. Volunteers are also trained to band birds and make standard measurements of birds. Volunteers also learn about Hall trapping and banding hummingbirds. The site is rugged, requiring above average fitness including: ability to hike on steep, potentially muddy and slippery terrain, and cover 2-4 miles on foot per day. Back or joint impairments, or obesity may make the project too challenging for some. \n\nVolunteers will have time to explore the Mindo area, and the team visits higher-elevation Bellavista Cloud Forest Reserve on the last day before returning to Quito. The December team will participate in the Mindo Christmas Bird Count (CBC), which typically wins first or second place globally for bird species counted. \n\nFood and Lodging: Accommodation is in a spacious research cabin, where each participant has a single bed mattress with mosquito netting, pillow, and fitted sheet. Two showers with hot water and flush toilets provide comfortable field accommodations. Meals are delicious, home-style Ecuadorian, prepared by excellent cooks, and vegetarian diets can be accommodated. \n\nCOST: Your contribution of $2450 covers transportation during the field project to and from Quito,Ecuador, meals at RLT, lodging at RLT, reserve entrance fees, salaries for Ecuadorian cooks and para-biologists, leader's costs, and a special lunch at the Bellavista Reserve. Airfare to and from Quito, Ecuador and expenses in Quito before and after the expedition are not included. Meals away from RLT during project are not included. \n\nYour cost-share helps sustain Reserva las Tangaras, supporting year-round stewardship, educational programs, outreach materials about cloud forest wildlife, maintenance of trails and signs, cabin repairs, and feeding of resident hummingbirds. Cost-share donations are used to operate the 2-week field expedition: providing the team with food, shelter, training and transportation, as well as purchasing new project equipment and supplies. \n\nThis exciting conservation expedition begins and ends in Quito, Ecuador. \n\nContact Dr. Dusti Becker, dustizuni@yahoo.com, for further details and to obtain a Life Net Nature volunteer application form. \n\nQualifications: Experience with banding and mist-netting are desirable, but not required. We provide training. Students and recent graduates will benefit from this great resume building experience. Professionals and retirees in field biology, will enjoy the \"field camp\" experience and are much appreciated for their co-mentoring and experiences they share. All participants have the option of using the > 20 year project database for research publications, undergraduate projects, or graduate degrees.  \n\nVisit https://lastangaras.wordpress.com/who-are-we/ for more details about Life Net Nature and Reserva Las Tangaras.  \n\nTo apply: Email Dr. Dusti Becker a brief cover e-mail detailing your experience and interest in participating on a given team.

The individual’s work will focus on critical mixed-grass prairie habitats and will utilize sites with various cattle grazing strategies. The REC’s location in the globally significant Prairie Pothole Region offers an unparalleled opportunity for field experience in a unique ecosystem which provides critical grassland habitat for an incredible diversity of wildlife and plants. Spending a summer immersed in what was once one of the largest grassland-wetland ecosystems is an exceptional experience for any candidate interested in conservation, range management, or wildlife/pollinator ecology!  \n\nTypical challenges associated with working in grasslands do apply, as field work will take place outdoors. Expect wide-ranging weather conditions, intense sun, mosquitos, ticks, long days working in the field, lots of walking, and exposure to intense sun, mosquitos, ticks, cattle, and hot/humid weather. Weekly-schedule will be variable. \n\nThe technician will be directly supervised by Taleigh Adrian, a PhD student, and will interact with NDSU faculty, students, and other research technicians.

This plan was refined and expanded by subsequent interns in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2025.\nThe Latino Heritage Intern will use interpretive themes and essential questions from Salem Maritime’s Foundation Document and Visitor Experience Plan (2020) and Saugus Iron Works’ Foundation Document and Visitor Experience Plan (2022) to research and develop audience-centered interpretive experiences focused on the parks’ natural and cultural resources. Potential programs may include historic house tours, maritime programs, nature walks, and tide walks.\nThe goal of the project is to create new park experiences attractive to the local Latino community. Currently, 23% of Essex County’s population (where Salem and Saugus are located) identifies as Hispanic or Latino. Programs may be bilingual but will primarily serve Spanish speakers. This aligns with a 2017 strategic plan for Salem and Saugus, which recommends prioritizing underrepresented students and groups to expand education programming (FY 2018–2023).\nThroughout the summer, the intern will expand existing programs and connections within the Latino community, particularly in El Punto, a predominantly Dominican and Puerto Rican neighborhood near Salem Maritime. The intern will contact existing community partners and establish new relationships with leaders and organizations in Essex County. The intern will also represent the parks at community-organized special events and outreach programs. In 2026, the intern will support programming related to America 250 and Salem 400+ anniversary events.\nDHA-RA Internship Deliverables include planning, preparing, promoting, and delivering:\nA bilingual (Spanish–English), audience-centered interpretive and educational program at Salem Maritime and/or Saugus Iron Works, presented multiple times.\nA special Latino Conservation Week event hosted at Salem Maritime NHP, featuring community partners such as the North Shore Community Development Coalition.\nWritten outlines, program materials, and vendor contacts for each program developed and presented.\nDocumentation of best practices for bilingual interpretive/educational programs in the Latino Commitment and Engagement Plan (2020) and presentation of recommendations to the Park Operations Team.\nSince 2018, Salem Maritime and Saugus Iron Works have prioritized working with adult interns through LHIP and HBCU programs. The parks have continuously evaluated ways to improve hiring and program creation. Staff participate in regular supervisory trainings to create a positive work environment. Hosting adult interns has led to significant impacts, including new partnerships and inclusive content development for both online and on-site visitors. The program continues to provide employment opportunities for young adults while serving diverse communities around each park unit.\n \nResponsibilities:\nResearch, develop, and deliver bilingual (Spanish–English), audience-centered interpretive and educational programs at both parks.\nUse park Foundation Documents and Visitor Experience Plans to guide program development focused on natural and cultural resources.\nExpand and refine the Latino Commitment and Engagement Plan by documenting best practices and presenting recommendations to park leadership.\nConduct outreach and build relationships with local Latiox community members, leaders, and organizations in Essex County.\nStrengthen existing partnerships and establish new collaborations, particularly within the El Punto neighborhood and surrounding communities.\nRepresent the parks at community-organized events, outreach activities, and special programs.\nPlan, promote, and present a bilingual interpretive program multiple times during the season.\nCoordinate and help deliver a Latino Conservation Week event in collaboration with community partners.\nSupport planning and programming related to America 250 and Salem 400+ anniversary events.\nPrepare program materials, outlines, and supplies; coordinate with external vendors as needed.\n\nQualifications:\nMajor in History, Anthropology, Sociology, Biology, Earth Sciences, Communications, or a related field.\nCurrently enrolled in or a recent graduate of an accredited undergraduate or graduate degree program.\nBilingual in Spanish and English, with strong communication skills for diverse audiences.\nInterest in community engagement and serving underrepresented audiences.\nExperience or interest in developing and delivering interpretive or educational programs.\nStrong written and oral communication skills.\nAbility to work independently and collaboratively in a team environment.\n\nLearning Goals:\nThe LHIP intern will gain experience in:\nResearching, developing, and implementing special programs and events for a diverse audience.\nCreating and maintaining professional relationships with individuals and community groups.\nCommunicating ideas and arguments in Spanish and English, both written and verbally.\nWorking collaboratively with National Park Service staff across multiple workgroups, as well as with park partner organizations.\n\nAbout the Site:\nSalem Maritime and Saugus Iron Works are National Park Service units located in Essex County, MA. Salem is a historic coastal city of about 45,000 people, while Saugus is a more suburban town of 28,000. Both communities provide easy access to grocery stores, shopping malls, movie theaters, and concert venues. Multiple hospitals are available in Essex County, including one in Salem; world-class hospitals are available 20 miles away in Boston.\nSummers in Essex County are warm, with an average daily high temperature above 72°F. July is the hottest month, with an average high of 80°F and low of 63°F.\nThe city of Salem is roughly 18% Hispanic or Latino, including a Dominican community in El Punto.

Add to that learning a new set of skills and gaining great field experience at one of the longest-running parrot projects in the Americas? If this sounds good to you, come and join our team of dedicated volunteers!\n\nFor over two decades, we’ve been working in the lowlands of southeastern Peru, led by Drs. Brightsmith and Vigo-Trauco from Texas A&M’s Schubot Center for Avian Health. Our research focuses on the breeding ecology of wild parrots and macaws in Tambopata, a region critical to conservation since 1999.\n\nVolunteers are the backbone of our work, contributing thousands of hours to understanding these incredible birds. Whether you’re passionate about wildlife, have a background in biology, or are just eager to gain field experience, we welcome you to be part of this rewarding journey.\n\nWith various programs designed for all experience levels—from birdwatching enthusiasts to graduate-level professionals—there’s an opportunity for everyone who’s responsible, enthusiastic, and ready for an adventure in conservation. Are you ready for a hands-on conservation experience in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth? Come join us in making a real difference!\n\nWe have different volunteer assistantships programs that require different levels of experience from amateur enthusiasts and birdwatchers to graduate-level professionals. Volunteer activities vary according to the position.\n\nLONG TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT\n\n Join our team and be trained to identify all local parrots by sight and sound. You’ll conduct parrot censuses in the forest and at clay licks, locate foraging parrots, and enter collected data into our system.

Other responsibilities include campsite setup and cooking.\n\nSPONSORED LONG TERM VOLUNTEER POSITION\n\nBe part of the “Harrison's Bird Foods Internship in the Rainforest Program”! You will receive comprehensive training similar to our long-term volunteers, including parrot identification, conducting censuses, monitoring foraging behaviors, tracking tree species macaws use, and entering data. In addition to tree climbing and nest observation, you’ll also assist with macaw chick health checks, including taking biometric measurements. You’ll play a key role in our nest monitoring expeditions throughout the Tambopata River basin. As with all positions, activities include campsite setup and cooking. \n\nQUALIFICATIONS\n\nLONG-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS:\n\nCandidates must have previous field experience and experience working with birds. A degree in Biology, Ecology, Forestry, Wildlife Sciences, or a related field, or be close to graduation, is required. \n\nAdditional Requirements: Volunteers should be in good physical condition, able to carry a 40 lb (18 kg) pack over moderate terrain for up to 2 km, and must have no fear of heights, particularly during the macaw breeding season (Dec-Mar). They should be able to work well in a team, handle stressful and challenging situations, and have travel insurance coverage\n\nSHORT-TERM VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS \n\nApplicants should have some experience observing animals, either in the wild or in captivity, along with an appreciation for nature and wildlife. \n\nAdditional Requirements:   \nVolunteers need to be in average physical condition, capable of walking 2 km over moderate terrain.

The station is a two-story wooden house with electricity generated by a gasoline generator and 75 Gb internet. The rooms are for two people and bathrooms and showers are shared. The first floor has a large area for common use of the different teams of researchers who stay there.\n\nCOST\nEssentially, volunteering is free. We take care of research permit costs, cover the costs of all staff, work to maintain training material, and also deal with all correspondence and various aspects of project management. However, our budget does not extend to being able to pay for all aspects of volunteer participation. As such you only need to cover food, accommodation, and other services provided by the field station. The costs are very reasonable. The daily fee is according to the position and experience:\n\n• Long-term assistant: 30 USD/day \n\n• Short-term assistant: 45 USD/day \n\n• SPONSORED Long-term assistant: NO COST (Thanks to the generous sponsorship from Harrison's Bird Foods) \n\n\n*A one-time processing fee of $30 will be added for all volunteers.\nThis rate covers food (3 meals per day) and accommodations (bedding is provided). All volunteers will be charged an airport transfer to be picked up ($20) or dropped off ($10) at the airport plus an extra cost to be transported to the port in private transportation ($45). Once a volunteer was accepted, they will be sent an invoice by email from Texas A&M University. Upon receipt, the volunteer needs to pay 20% of the total cost of their stay. This non-refundable payment is required to hold the reservation for the assistant. The remaining 80% of the payment should be made at least two weeks before the assistant arrives at the release site. Arrangements can be made if assistants wish to pay in cash in the country. However, prior permission from the coordinator is needed. Changes to the daily fee may apply according to availability and season\n\n  Contact\nDr. Gabriela Vigo-Trauco\nvolunteering@themacawsociety.org (preferred contact method)",

However, our budget does not extend to being able to pay for all aspects of volunteer participation. As such you only need to cover food, accommodation, and other services provided by the field station. The costs are very reasonable. The daily fee is according to the position and experience:\n\n• Long-term assistant: 30 USD/day \n\n• Short-term assistant: 45 USD/day \n\n• SPONSORED Long-term assistant: NO COST (Thanks to the generous sponsorship from Harrison's Bird Foods) \n\n\n*A one-time processing fee of $30 will be added for all volunteers.\nThis rate covers food (3 meals per day) and accommodations (bedding is provided). All volunteers will be charged an airport transfer to be picked up ($20) or dropped off ($10) at the airport plus an extra cost to be transported to the port in private transportation ($45). Once a volunteer was accepted, they will be sent an invoice by email from Texas A&M University. Upon receipt, the volunteer needs to pay 20% of the total cost of their stay. This non-refundable payment is required to hold the reservation for the assistant. The remaining 80% of the payment should be made at least two weeks before the assistant arrives at the release site. Arrangements can be made if assistants wish to pay in cash in the country. However, prior permission from the coordinator is needed. Changes to the daily fee may apply according to availability and season\n\n\nContact\nDr. Gabriela Vigo-Trauco\nvolunteering@themacawsociety.org (preferred contact method)",

Austin State University (Nacogdoches, Texas)\nTags:\nGraduate Opportunities\nDescription\n Position: The Montaña Aquatic Ecology Lab (https://www.carmengmontana.com/) at the Department of Biology at Stephen F. Austin State University is recruiting a Master’s student to begin in Summer 2026 (preferred) or Fall 2026. The position is funded for 2 years, and will be based in the research group of Dr. Montaña at Stephen F. Austin State University (SFASU). Student will receive a stipend of $2,000/month and Nonresident (NR) tuition is waived (resident tuition fees apply). \n Research Focus: This study will use a multiscale perspective to survey the freshwater fishes in streams/rivers of east Texas to identify relationships within basin-scale connectivity and stream flow and reach-scales physicochemical characteristics in the context of aiding the current distribution of imperiled fish species (shiners and suckers) within the Neches and Sabine River basins in Texas. \nThis research will use a combination of fishing gears and sampling methods to accurately assess freshwater fishes with efforts focused on several native imperiled fish species. The surveys will be conducted on a yearly basis including three seasons (spring, summer, and fall) to better understand changes in fish assemblage dynamics over time. Surveys will also include multiscale habitat analysis to quantify habitats a finer (e.g., reach, mesohabitat) and broader (e.g., landscape) scales to help identify environmental variables associated with the occurrence of imperiled shiners and suckers over time. In addition, novel approaches based on PIT tagging and stable isotope analysis of carbon [δ13C], nitrogen [δ15N], and Sulfur (δ34S) will be conducted to evaluate and monitor movement patterns and habitat use by proposed imperiled species within the Neches and Sabine River basins. \n Desired Qualifications: Individuals with research interests in aquatic ecology, fish ecology/fisheries, river/stream ecology, food-web ecology, and/or conservation ecology are especially encouraged to apply. Candidates must hold a Bachelor’s degree by the start date in Biology, Ecology, Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences, or related field. Demonstrated experience in fish sampling and identification; use of water quality meters, proficiency in Microsoft Office (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint), have an understanding of biodiversity metrics. Coding in R, ArGIS skills, and stable isotope processing is a plus, though all of these can be learned during graduate school. Experience with driving a boat/trailer is required. The ability to conduct rigorous fieldwork under extreme conditions (e.g., heat, humidity) will be necessary. Excellent communication, time-management skills, a strong work ethic and attention to detail also are essential. Self-motivated and able to work independently and collaboratively is expected. The candidate must also have a valid driver’s license (will need to get a Texas driver license). \n About the Area/University: SFASU is located in Nacogdoches, Texas. The Department of Biology has (http://www.sfasu.edu/academics/colleges/sciences-math/biology) a diverse faculty with strengths in ecology and evolutionary ecology, conservation biology, botany, and cellular and molecular biology.

Having played a role in the creation of the BWCA, we are looking to protect the BWCA and northeastern Minnesotan ecosystems from climate change for decades to come.\n\nTo this end, Friends is seeking a Climate Change and Conservation Associate. Friends has recently received a grant from the Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund (ENRTF) to fund a project entitled, The Impacts of Climate Change on Northeastern Minnesota. The Climate Change and Conservation Associate will assist in the implementation of this project.\n\nBackground on the ENRTF Grant:\nClimate change is rapidly increasing temperatures in the Quetico-Superior ecosystem of northeastern Minnesota, impacting the habitat and wildlife of the region. A range of government, tribal, academic, and private entities have conducted research relating to existing and future impacts of climate change on the region; however, this information is siloed and fragmented across multiple databases and sources. As a consequence, it is difficult to develop a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of climate change on the region’s ecosystems and assess appropriate responses to these impacts.\n\nFriends’ Climate and Conservation Program looks to provide leadership on climate resilience in the Boundary Waters and northern Minnesota. \n\nTo address these challenges, through the ENRTF grant, Friends will:\n\n(1) Lead a systematic review of climate research in the Quetico-Superior ecosystem while engaging local, state, and federal governments; tribal governments; academic institutions; and nonprofit organizations to collect and aggregate studies, research, management plans and other data relating to the impacts of climate change on land, water, wildlife, management, recreation, and human health in northeastern Minnesota. We will use this data to develop plain-language summaries of findings, identify major research opportunities in northeast Minnesota, test the efficacy of certain land management decisions, and illustrate what the future of northern ecosystems might look like depending on management decisions we make now. \n\n(2) Develop a publicly available, web-based hub of studies, research, management plans, and other information relating to the impacts of climate change on ecosystems in northeastern Minnesota. The website will serve several purposes. It will support public understanding of climate impacts, arm policy makers with climate-smart land management strategies, and inspire the next generation of ecologists in the region. \n\nThe Climate Change and Conservation Associate will be responsible for assisting with these deliverables. \n\nThese positions and this program will continue beyond the duration of the three-year ENRTF grant and will form the basis for the Friends’ new Climate Change and Conservation Program.\n\nPRIMARY RELATIONSHIPS:\n\nReports directly to the Climate and Conservation Manager.\nWorks effectively with other departments within the Friends, including Development, Policy, Communications, Northern Communities, and Education.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\nReview and synthesize peer-reviewed manuscripts, reports, and data\nHelp to organize hundreds of peer-reviewed manuscripts and reports\nDevelop maps and public-facing resources that facilitate good land and water management in northeastern Minnesota\nEngage local, state, and federal governments; tribal governments; academic institutions; and nonprofit organizations to identify their needs, collect and aggregate studies, research, management plans and other data relating to the impacts of climate change on the habitat and wildlife of northeastern Minnesota\nContribute to the development of a publicly available, web-based, electronic database of studies, research, management plans, and other information relating to the impacts of climate change on the habitat and wildlife of northeastern Minnesota\nMonitor scientific and policy developments pertaining to climate change and wildlife conservation  in northeastern Minnesota\nRepresent Friends at events and serve as a spokesperson for Friends\n\nQUALIFICATIONS\nMasters degree in natural sciences with interdisciplinary experience, or 3 years applied experience with undergraduate degree in natural sciences\nUnderstanding of climate change, land and water management (both strategies and tradeoffs), and ecology, particularly in northern ecosystems\nDemonstrated ability to translate complex scientific data or research into easy-to-understand material appropriate for public consumption\nExperience with GIS and map creation\nExperience with data cleaning, carpentry, and summarization in R or Python (proficiency with meta-analysis is a plus)\nExperience doing research synthesis and science communication with state, federal, Tribal, NGOs, or private sector partners\nInitiative, good judgment, and a strong work ethic\nAbility to work independently and in collaboration with staff and outside partners\nAbility to engage positively with a broad array of people and constituencies, including Tribal governments\nAbility to work on multiple projects of strategic importance while meeting deadlines\nExperience navigating complicated political landscapes and relationships\nPassion for conserving the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and the Quetico-Superior ecosystem\n\nCOMPENSATION AND BENEFITS:\n$60,000 – $70,000 per year\nPaid vacation and sick leave, health and dental insurance, and a 403(b) retirement plan.\nIn addition to paid vacation and sick leave, Friends provides a $600 stipend and five additional paid vacation days to each employee to take time off and recharge in the Boundary Waters.\nFlexible working hours and hybrid working options\nWe encourage life-long learning and ongoing professional development.\n\nTO APPLY\nEmail a:\nCover letter\nResume\nWriting sample that demonstrates effective science communication (blog, peer-reviewed publication, or report that weaves together multiple sources)\nThree references\nTo Case McCullough at casey@friends-bwca.org. In the subject line of any electronic communication, please put “Climate Change and Conservation Associate.”\n\nApplications will be accepted until March 4, 2026.\n\nAt Friends, we have a clear vision to be the place where a diverse mix of talented people want to come, to stay, and do their best work. Friends is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age or veteran status. \n\n\nContact\nCase McCullough\ncasey@friends-bwca.org (preferred contact method)",

ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nThe Adaptive Cropping Systems Laboratory (ACSL) at the USDA-ARS Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) in Beltsville, Maryland conducts integrated experimental and modeling research to understand how crops respond to key abiotic factors such as weather, soil conditions, and management practices. Our team designs and carries out controlled experiments and develops, validates, and applies advanced mathematical models to investigate a wide range of agricultural challenges, including the impacts of extreme weather on crop production, land suitability assessment, food security, on-farm resource management, and farmer competitiveness.\n\nResearch Project: Our stakeholders—including farmers and crop advisors—need clear, science-based guidance on how to manage farming operations in response to current and projected weather and soil conditions. We are seeking an intern to continue development of an existing web-based portable information delivery system (ID) that integrates on-farm data streams, ACSL crop and soil models, and weather forecasts. This toolkit is intended to provide in-season decision support, helping end users optimize site-specific farm management.\n\nThe participant will continue development of an existing IDS platform and support its deployment with end-users under the guidance of laboratory mentors. Activities will include computer programming related to database development, extension of the IDS graphical user interface, and integration of our crop and soil models. Database activities will involve capturing model-based scenario input and output data that can be queried in real time. The participant will also collaborate with on-site scientific staff to transition components of an existing Windows-based graphical interface into the new web-based IDS framework. Additional opportunities include exploring portable versions of our models and applying artificial intelligence methods to enable interaction through mobile platforms.\n\nLearning Objectives: The participant will collaborate with an established multidisciplinary team with international expertise in crop and soil modeling, gaining knowledge about extreme weather impacts, and how crops and soils respond to genetic, environmental, and management inputs. The participant will develop new skills in computer programming and model application and will gain experience engaging with stakeholders in the development and use of decision-support technologies for agricultural systems.\n\nDeployment of the web-based IDS during the participant’s term is expected to draw significant attention from crop consultants, scientists, and other agricultural stakeholders outside the laboratory. The participant will receive full credit for their contributions, including recognition as a co-principal investigator in the web-app contributors list. This visibility can help establish the participant as an innovative and impactful software engineer, potentially opening the door to additional high-profile opportunities.\n\nThe participant will also interact daily with world-class experts in agricultural modeling, agronomic science, and model-based decision support. These interactions will broaden their experience across multiple scientific disciplines and strengthen their confidence in developing innovative, stakeholder-oriented software tools.\n\nMentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is David Fleisher (david.fleisher@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: March 1, 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $64,000 - $110,000 annually.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\n\nQuestions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process, please email ORISE.ARS.Northeast@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.\n\nQualifications\nThe qualified candidate should have received or be currently pursuing an associate's, bachelor's, master's, or doctoral in the one of the relevant fields.\n\nPreferred skills:\n\nDemonstrated self-starter with postgraduate level experience (BS or MS with 3 + years) in computer science / data science or related field with demonstrated experience in software engineering.\nSelection factors include coding proficiency / experience in: API and front-end development (eg. HTML, CSS, JavaScript); programming languages (e.g. PYTHON); relational databases and query languages (e.g. SQL); testing/troubleshooting software programming using debugging tools; source control management (e.g. Git, TeamFoundation). \nFamiliarity with Docker containers and both Windows and Linux operating systems will be extremely helpful. \n\nContact\nUSDA-ARS-NEA-2026-0016\ncontact via the web posting is preferred (see Details section)",

DAWR is tasked with protecting Guam’s natural resources by working through partnerships to conserve and manage fish and wildlife and their habitats for the use and enjoyment of current and future generations. In particular, the Wildlife Office works closely with Guam's native bird and bat species, specifically the Guam rail (Ko'ko'), Guam kingfisher (Sihek), Micronesian Starling (Såli), Mariana swiftlet (Yayaguak), Mariana moorhen (Pulattat), and Mariana fruit bat (Fanihi). We also work to educate the public about invasive species such as the brown treensnake and the threats they pose to native wildlife. DAWR also collaborates with federal agencies and local environmental groups on conservation projects in pursuit of wildlife restoration on Guam.\n\nDetails & Responsibilities\n\nThis person will contribute to DAWR's monitoring of Guam's native bird and bat species. Avian monitoring methods include point count surveys, audio playbacks and recordings, camera trapping, nest monitoring, and radio telemetry. Bat colonies are monitored via roost counts and flyover surveys. The majority of work will take place in the field, primarily on Islan Dåno' (Cocos Island), a small islet off the southern coast of Guam (daily boat transportation provided) but also in other forest and watershed habitats across Guam. This will include species identification and monitoring, data collection, and maintenance of equipment and survey stations. Additionally, this person will be responsible for data entry and database management in the office, and will assist with data analysis and report writing.\n\nBiologists also participate in public outreach events and classroom visits with trained education birds. On a limited basis, this person may also assist in husbandry for DAWR's captive breeding programs of Guam rail and Guam kingfisher. There may be opportunities for additional trainings and off-island travel for conferences and workshops.\n\nBenefits\n\nThis is a full-time, permanent position with the Government of Guam and comes with full health care and retirement benefits, sick leave, holidays, and vacation hours. We will likely be able to provide some relocation assistance, such as a one-way plane ticket to Guam and a small sum for other relocation expenses, though we cannot guarantee this at this time.\n\nQualifications\n \nApplicants must have graduated from a recognized college or university with a Bachelor’s degree in biology, wildlife science, fishery science, zoology or related fields.

Its primary purpose is to serve the original needs of the NGO’s operations which are wildlife conservation through research and education. This is accomplished through the layout of the farm which provides extensive wildlife habitat and foraging opportunities, increasing the local faunal biodiversity as well as acting as an educational demonstration to local subsistence farmers and visiting students.  \n  Interns will learn by assisting in implementation and evaluation of management practices, cropping, and record keeping on the farm with this vision in mind while we endeavor to maximize the products coming from the farm with the existing design and layout using sustainable and regenerative practices specific to the Mesoamerican uplands. Within this broad framework, intern projects can include several basic Agricultural Education disciplines including Tropical Agriculture, Sustainable/organic Agriculture, Farm Management, Waste management, and Agricultural Economics.  \n  In addition to planting crops, we also have free range chickens and ducks for eggs and meat. We are looking to increase our revenue generation from the farm either in the form of increased accountable products entering our kitchen for use in our restaurant, or for sale to the Mobile Market or in a proposed road-side café which would be managed by T.R.E.E.S kitchen and hospitality staff. Thus, interns would also assist us with our marketing strategy for existing products and/or planting. \n  By the successful conclusion of this internship, the student will be able to apply practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species, basic free range poultry operations, evaluate different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns, and become familiar with sustainable management practices such as no/low till, cover cropping, waste management, mulching, marketing, Farm-to-Table, etc. \n    Requirements: \n No prior tropical agriculture experience required. Interns can be current undergraduate or graduate students enrolled in a program with their University/College for credit, however non-students can also apply; but preference will be given to students enrolled in an accreditation program. Experienced tropical agriculturalists and/or agroforestry professionals are also welcome and will be treated according to their experience level and are eligible for *discounted rates. \n    Internship Responsibilities: \n Applying practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species and basic free range poultry operations. \nEvaluating different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns. \nWork on Inga Alley-cropping and other regenerative cropping practices, and using intercropping, organic fertilizing and pest control practices. \nAssist with innovative marketing strategies for existing products accompanied by reviewing projected budgets for the farm and their products and exploring cost/profit ratios for poultry husbandry. \nPlanting and selling new products for the farm. \nOpportunities are also available to observe and participate with concurrent intern and wildlife educational activities such as mist-netting, observing and recording measurements of bats, birds, herps, invertebrates, water quality, and much more. \nInterns will assist with creating captions for social media posts to engage and update followers on what has been going on at the field station and various projects that are being done. \n     Costs: \n The internship fee includes room and board (meals included Monday-Friday), full access to lab equipment, and training by professional on-site biologists. Food is a combination of self-catering in a communal kitchen with ingredients provided as well as prepared meals, depending on whether we have other groups on site. Lodging at the research center signifies a shared dormitory-style rustic cabins with other same sex interns. This comes with full access to other facilities such as showers, restrooms, and kitchen. The nature of this program allows interns to carry out most of the work independently after the training period is done. Fees do not include airport transfer, flights, travel medical insurance, or $100 USD visitor permit fee if remaining in country for more than 30 days.    \n  We are hoping to expand our internship program beyond North America. Citizens from Latin America and the Caribbean will be charged at a discounted rate of 50%. Belizeans will get another discount. For more information, kindly email Scandia Cruz with the email provided above. \n    Schedule: \n Interns are required to work for 35 hours/week minimum. The typical schedule runs from Monday through Friday, from 6:30 am until 12:30 pm and 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm. Weekends are free time for interns; therefore, you can do as please (travel, hike, relax). No refunds on food and lodging will be available if the intern decides to leave the station. Projects may sometimes run into the weekend; in which case the days will be returned to them during the week. The intern supervisor(s) will be responsible for designing a schedule with the intern each week that is reasonable and includes work on the various projects. \n  Application:  \n For more information on our organization and facilities please visit our website: www.treesociety.org.

There are multiple biological surveys that interns conduct including weekly waterfowl population monitoring, water level measurements, acoustic bat monitoring, and grassland surveys. Interns will assist with upkeep of refuge infrastructure including weed eating and applying herbicide treatment to parking lots, guardrails, and around water control structures. Interns preform maintenance on trails, including trimming over-hanging limbs, removal of fallen trees, and overall trail conditions. To maintain proper hydrologic function of the refuge interns will remove beaver dams and debris from creeks and water control structures. This will entail hiking along creek edges and/or canoeing on the refuge. Possible additional duties include helping with public use events and assisting the maintenance staff and visitor services staff with various tasks, construction, or repair projects as needed. Throughout the internship there are also possible opportunities for assisting with geese and dove banding as well as completing the coursework to obtain a red card for wild land firefighting. \n\nAdditional Information\n\nThe internships are unpaid, free housing and utilities are available with the intern working a minimum of 24 hours per week. With the internship being unpaid we do allow for interns to look for a part time job off refuge but require that a minimum of 24 hours per week be reached to stay in refuge housing. Interns can expect approximately 40 hours per week of work unless an alternate 24 hours schedule is arranged. The housing is comfortable. Typically, there are 3-4 people in the house, the house is co-ed; rooms will be separated by gender. The house is fully furnished and includes twin beds.

Our maintenance shops are across the street from the house and offer an additional shower and restroom, and another washer and dryer. \n\n This internship is an excellent steppingstone to your future career. Many of our previous interns now work in Federal and State jobs, in non-profits like The Audubon Society and The Wild Turkey Federation, and many are employed in Academia. There is no specific requirement for course of study, however, the applicant must be a current college student or have recently graduated (within the past two years). Preference will be given to students who are majoring in the science field, e.g. biology, wildlife science, ecology, environmental science, botany, mammalogy or similar disciplines.

We are hiring up to six BICs to assist with the operations of our network of Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) banding stations, operated collaboratively with The Institute for Bird Populations (http://www.birdpop.org/maps.htm). Our MAPS program is supported by the Oil Sands Monitoring program, a collaborative initiative within Alberta Environment and Protected Areas that brings researchers together across a broad range of terrestrial biological monitoring. Program objectives are to understand the effects of oil sands development and the cumulative impacts of development on songbird populations. Under this initiative, our MAPS program includes banding stations near Conklin, Lac la Biche and Cold Lake, as well as near to and north of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The BIC would be responsible for the maintenance and operation of six remote MAPS banding stations. Positions would commence on May 20, and would extend through August 8, 2026. You would be expected to arrive in Fort McMurray on May 19, to begin training early on May 20. \n Successful candidates must have advanced skills in mist-netting, bird banding, identifying, aging and sexing of landbirds in the hand, ability to identify birds by song, operation of a banding station, data management, and either hold or qualify to hold a CWS bird-banding subpermit. NABC certification and previous experience with the MAPS protocol would be very useful assets. The successful candidate would supervise, guide, and provide advanced training to their assistant on bird-banding, aging and sexing of birds, and banding station operations.

Applicants must hold a current, valid driver’s licence (equivalent to Alberta Class 5), allowing them to drive (truck would be provided) in Alberta.\n BIC’s would be employees of OMEI and would receive payment of between CA$4,000 and CA$4,200 (less required deductions) per month (paid every two weeks), depending on experience. Food and accommodation would be provided. Successful applicants would have their travel paid or receive a travel allowance to offset the costs of travel to and from Fort McMurray. BIC’s would adhere to OMEI safety and industrial site requirements for working in this region, including government agency and client directives relating to pandemics, and would be required to pass a pre-employment Alcohol & Drug test. Safety training courses (e.g., First Aid/CPR, OSSA Basic Safety Orientation, Bear Awareness) would be provided. Upon completing the season adequately and responsibly and adhering to all required safety protocols, BICs would receive a lump-sum bonus of CA$2,500 at the conclusion of the program. No health or other benefits beyond those described herein would be included.\n Applications must include a cover letter, resume, and the name and contact information of three persons as references.

Once a thriving native species on Isle Royale National Park (Minong), lynx were extirpated a century ago. With growing interest in lynx reestablishment to Isle Royale, we have a unique opportunity to evaluate the implications of potential lynx restoration to the ecological integrity of Isle Royale National Park and the donor population on the adjacent mainland. This project proposes to build a scientific framework to determine whether reintroducing lynx to Isle Royale is feasible and beneficial for the island's ecosystem, as well as the donor ecosystem. Our framework is anticipated to be applicable to broader regional conservation goals for lynx and for carnivore reintroductions globally. \n We are seeking one post-doctoral associate to evaluate i) Habitat Suitability: evaluate whether Isle Royale can support a viable lynx population; ii) Population Viability and Genetic Health: assess the long-term sustainability of a reintroduced lynx population, including the risks of genetic erosion; iii) Community Impacts: predict how lynx reintroduction will influence Isle Royale’s predator-prey dynamics and broader mammalian community. Simultaneously, we will examine the potential impacts on the mainland source population, on the Grand Portage Indian Reservation, to ensure minimal disruption. The Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa are culturally affiliated with Minong, the Anishinaabe place name for Isle Royale, and have practiced stewardship of natural resources on Minong and the north shore of Minnesota for millennia.\n To accomplish this work, we will leverage existing data and ecological modeling to map habitat suitability and model population dynamics on Isle Royale and in Grand Portage, simulate genetic and demographic scenarios for both island and mainland populations, and analyze the cascading effects of lynx reintroduction on the current ecological communities. This position will be based in the Pauli Lab (https://pauli.russell.wisc.edu/) in the Department of Forestry and Wildlife at the University of Wisconsin -Madison under the supervision of Dr. Jonathan Pauli. They will also work closely with biologists at Isle Royale National Park and Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. \n The postdoctoral position is for 1.5 years.  The appointment will be as a research associate.  Salary is competitive and commensurate with experience, and health benefits are included.  The position is available immediately, and we seek to fill it by September 1st 2026, but a later start date is negotiable. Review of applicants will begin immediately, but the positions will remain open until a suitable candidate is found.  Applications received by January 31st are guaranteed consideration.\n Qualifications:  We seek candidates who work well in a collaborative setting and have excellent communication and writing skills.  Good English writing and verbal communication skills, as well as the ability to work in a team, are essential.  Candidates should have demonstrated skills in the processing and handling of datasets, especially as it relates to population and community dynamics of wildlife.  Applicants for the post-doc position must have completed their Ph.D. at the time of appointment and have published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  \n\nTo apply:  Please submit your application here: \nPostdoc position: Lynx Reintroduction \n Submitting an application includes filling out a small survey and takes approximately 15 minutes.

Priority is given to applicants that can start in April or early May and can stay at least through July or as late as October. Applicants with a start date after June 1 may apply for a late Summer/Fall Internship. There are no internship opportunities in the off-season (November – March). \n Location\nDays begin with field work conducted on Longboat Key, Lido Key, Siesta Key, Casey Key and Venice and end at the offices at Mote Marine Laboratory's City Island Campus.\nMote Marine Laboratory, Sarasota, FL\n\n About the Program\nThe Sea Turtle Conservation & Research Program (STCRP) has monitored sea turtle activity since 1982. The program supports conservation of the marine turtles (primarily Caretta caretta and Chelonia mydas) of the central Gulf Coast of Florida through the collection of fundamental biological data about nesting and hatching of sea turtles in a portion of Sarasota and Manatee Counties. The STCRP is a community-based program consisting of 5-7 staff members, 14-20 interns, and approximately 300 volunteers. The STCRP also works with agencies throughout the state to support conservation efforts for these federally protected marine turtles.\n\nIntern Duties Interns participate in daily sea turtle nesting surveys that begin at dawn throughout nesting season (April 15 - October 31). During nesting surveys, participants walk the beach (or patrol by using an All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) at select locations), respond to, and document sea turtle activities. Once field work on the beach is completed, staff and interns return to Mote Marine Laboratory to perform office duties such as data entry, preparations for the next day, communicating with government agencies when required, scanning data sheets, painting stakes, and contacting STCRP volunteers for problem resolution and feedback. Interns also assist in informally educating the public about sea turtles, the hazards they face, and the proper actions humans should take when turtles are encountered. Specific field work activities are dependent on the time of the season, the degree of turtle activity and environmental factors, but in general, interns will be trained to do the tasks listed below: \n •Identify false crawls and nests \n•Identify sea turtle species from tracks \n•Verify nests (dig to locate eggs) \n•Stake off new nests \n•Complete required data forms \n•Respond to depredations, washovers/washouts, or other activities that negatively impact nests \n•Respond to adult and/or hatchling disorientation events \n•Excavate hatched nests (inventory of nest contents) \n•Complete office tasks as previously described above \n Interns will receive preliminary training by reviewing videos, slide shows, and manuals prior to the start of the internship. Once at Mote, interns will receive one-on-one training in the field and office. \n\nField work can be strenuous, may require walking long distances in soft sand, and is conducted every morning of the season despite inclement weather. Daily temperatures will reach 90+ degrees for a significant portion of the summer. Humid conditions with frequent showers and thunderstorms are normal. Prolonged rainfall often occurs in connection with tropical disturbances or hurricanes. Hot, buggy, sandy, or wet conditions can be expected. \n\nA typical day begins at dawn and can be long and challenging, as each day presents variable conditions (such as storms) that can impact the workload. Interns often work on weekends, but they will have two consistent consecutive days off during the week. Obtaining a second job during the internship is not recommended due to the variability of the schedule and the heavy workload. \n\nThe likelihood of interacting with adult sea turtles is rare, as they primarily nest at night and nesting surveys begin at dawn. Occasionally, a nesting female will still be on the beach in the morning, though it is rare. Interactions with hatchlings (live and dead) can be expected, though is limited for the protection of the turtles. \n\nRequirements \nCollege students or recent graduates that are responsible, adaptable, motivated to learn and with an attention to detail are encouraged to apply. This internship is an immersive, highly demanding, field-based role. We are looking for candidates who understand that reliability, dedication, and flexibility are critical to success and that maturity and professionalism are necessary when working with the public, STCRP staff members, and STCRP volunteers. \n Specific requirements: \n•MUST HAVE A VALID DRIVER’S LICENSE AND DEPENDABLE VEHICLE. Interns are responsible for transporting themselves and field equipment to the various beaches and Mote. A bicycle is not an acceptable alternative. \n•A commitment to participate in the program for at least 10 weeks, though longer is preferred. \n•A minimum of 18 years of age and engaged in or recently completed undergraduate studies. \n•A background or degree in Marine Science/Biology/Ecology or related field preferred. \n•Field research experience preferred, but not required. \n•Ability to walk long distances in soft sand, handle high temperatures, humidity, and insects,withstand exposure to intense sunlight, and carry up to 30 lbs. \n Benefits/Costs\nInterns will be responsible for their own transportation to and from Sarasota and living expenses during the time of the internship. All selected interns will receive a biweekly (every other week) stipend of $200 to cover mileage incurred on the intern’s personal vehicle while performing internship duties. Interns must have a U.S. social security number in order to receive stipend payments. Additional need-based stipends are available from Mote Marine Laboratory. Applications can be found on the Mote Internship Application webpage (see below). The STCRP is not involved in the need-based stipend review process. Please note that need-based stipends are separate from the biweekly $200 transportation stipend.\n\nApplication/Contact Information\nIf you are interested in applying for an internship with the STCRP please complete and submit an internship application which can be found on the Mote Marine Laboratory College Internship webpage. On the application, when asked for your first choice program, choose Sea Turtle Conservation and Research. Read over the application carefully and provide all the required materials to the Mote Intern Office (statement of interest, current college transcript, letter of recommendation, resume, etc.). Incomplete applications may not be considered.\n \nPLEASE NOTE that the nighttime tagging internship is a separate internship than the one described above.\n Applicants may contact Gina Hodson at intern@mote.org with any general questions related to Mote internships.

We engage youth (age 15-17) and young adults (ages 18-30, up to 35 for veterans) in service projects on public lands throughout the Southeast. SECC collaborates with land management agencies (United States Forest Service, National Park Service, State Parks, local municipalities, and non-profits) to host day or overnight camping crews and individual placements. \n Our AmeriCorps positions provide impactful educational and service opportunities that benefit both communities and landscapes. SECC’s participants reflect the population of the Southeast region, including youth, graduates, veterans, and individuals from various ethnic and economic backgrounds. \n   Description of Duties \nThe crew member position is an entry-level role. During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors in all weather conditions, performing heavy manual labor to complete conservation and restoration projects. Most projects require hiking out to remote work sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack. While prior experience with the outdoors or outdoor work can be helpful, it is not a necessity for this position. We ask that crew members embrace learning opportunities, face challenges, and build community with their crew. \n    Service Project: \nThe crew will be based out of SECC’s office in Chattanooga, TN and travel to complete various conservation projects directly supporting Hurricane Helene disaster recovery efforts in the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest. The crew will collaborate with U.S. Forest Service land managers to complete conservation projects.    \n\nIn 2024, the southeast was impacted by Hurricane Helene, causing significant damage to trails and recreation areas within national forests. This crew will focus on repairing storm-impacted trails by constructing trail reroutes, restoring damaged tread, repairing bridges, re-establishing trail corridor, and logging out down trees. Trail maintenance will require use of carpentry and hand tools. During their time in the field, crew members camp overnight and serve outdoors on rugged terrain in all weather conditions, often in remote wilderness areas, performing heavy manual labor related to conservation and restoration projects.  Most projects require hiking out to project sites for the day with tools, equipment, and a day pack.  \n\nService projects vary depending on seasonal factors and safety considerations. While the staff at SECC and partners strive to provide consistency throughout the season, personal flexibility is expected and should be prepared for when entering the term as schedules, times, and project locations are subject to change per project needs.
