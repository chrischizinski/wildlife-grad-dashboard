    "description": "PhD assistantship: Rio Grande cutthroat trout conservation and genetics\nNew Mexico State University (State)\nDetails\nApplication Deadline:\n03/18/2026\nPublished:\n02/18/2026\nStarting Date:\n8/17/2026\nHours per Week:\nat least 20\nSalary:\n$28,384 to $29,041 per year\nEducation Required:\nBachelors\nExperience Required:\nnone\nLocation:\nNew Mexico State University (Las Cruces, New Mexico)\nTags:\nGraduate Opportunities\nDescription\nRIO GRANDE CUTTHROAT TROUT PHD ASSISTANTSHIP\n\nDescription & project background: \n\nThe Pregler Lab at New Mexico State University in the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Ecology invites applications for a PhD research assistantship focused on Rio Grande cutthroat trout conservation. The successful applicant will begin in the Fall 2026 semester.\n\nRio Grande cutthroat trout (RGCT) are the southernmost species of cutthroat trout and have experienced a severe decline in both range and abundance, now occupying only ~12 percent of its historical distribution and requires targeted management interventions to support recovery. Major components of the recovery plan detail the need to secure extant populations and reintroduce individuals within their native range in Colorado and New Mexico. Recent efforts to date include development of a multi-source, genetically diverse broodstock for the Rio Grande basin that is used for reintroduction efforts.\n\nIndividuals from this multi-source broodstock were stocked at multiple sites throughout the recently restored Rio Costilla watershed which represents one of the largest native fish restoration projects in the country. While recent research has shown that this composite broodstock is more genetically diverse compared to using single source populations there is a need to evaluate how these fish are performing in the wild. The present project has a number of goals:\n\n          1. Evaluate genetic structure and diversity of reintroduced Rio Costilla RGCT populations\n                     a. There is also opportunity to develop questions with demographic monitoring data in this system.\n          2. Genetic assessment of Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos basins. \n                     a. Results will help inform multi-source broodstock development for Canadian & Pecos basins and identify additional source populations for Rio Grande basin.\n                     b. Results will also provide an updated genetic assessment for RGCT.\n          3. There are additional opportunities for the student to develop their own questions using genetic and demographic data.\n\nThis project is a collaborative effort funded by the New Mexico Department of Wildlife and there may be potential to collaborate with other university researchers and agencies. Benefits include a salary range of ~$28-29k/year, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance. Funding will also be available for conference travel, workshop training for data analyses, and safety training (e.g., wilderness first aid). The hired candidate will begin in Fall 2026 and will be based at NMSU in Las Cruces, NM.\n\nHow to apply: If interested, please compile the following: (1) a statement of interest that describes your educational and research background, as well as your research interests and how this position fits in your career goals (2) curriculum vitae or resume, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts compiled in a single PDF and save as ‘Lastname_RGCT_PhD.pdf’.  Applicants are also asked to upload a writing sample in the application portal. Applications should be submitted through the airtable linked here:  https://airtable.com/app3jNqbQZsYstwx7/pagrpU5GqaI6FnSTg/form \n\nApplications are due 03/18/26 by 11:59p MT. You can learn more about the Pregler Lab at https://preglerlab.com and any questions about the position can be sent to Dr. Kasey Pregler at kpregler@nmsu.edu.   \n\nQualifications: \n\nRequired: B.S. in fisheries, biology, or related field and possession of a valid U.S. driver’s license. The successful applicant must also meet the minimum requirements for admission to the NMSU Graduate School (3.0 GPA in last two years of undergrad). Applicants should also have demonstrated excellent written and oral communication skills, and an ability to work independently. \n\nPreference will be given to applicants with an M.S. degree in fisheries, biology, or related field and have experience working in the backcountry and are willing to lead field work crews in backcountry conditions.\n\nSuccessful candidates will have proficiency in R, and an interest in genetics and working with large datasets. They should also demonstrate the ability to work as part of a team and have a willingness to lead field work crews in remote backcountry locations.

Assistantship – Raven Movement Ecology in Prairie Canada\nDr. Adam Janke & Dr. Gunnar Kramer – Iowa State University\nDr. Jay VonBank, Dr. Todd Arnold, Dr. Frank Rohwer & Jacob Bushaw – Delta Waterfowl Foundation\n PROJECT BACKGROUND\nDelta Waterfowl, in collaboration with Iowa State University (ISU), is recruiting a highly motivated M.S. student to investigate the movement ecology of common ravens and their role in waterfowl nest depredation within the prairie/parkland ecosystems of Saskatchewan, Canada. Ravens represent a relatively new and increasingly abundant nest predator in this region, and their expanding distribution poses emerging challenges for waterfowl reproductive success.\n This research will focus on quantifying spatial and temporal movement patterns of ravens using advanced GPS telemetry. The student will investigate how raven movement strategies, habitat-use dynamics, and associated behaviors contribute to waterfowl nest depredation. Results from this work will directly inform predator management strategies to enhance conservation planning for waterfowl populations within the northern Prairie Pothole Region. The selected candidate will collaborate closely with scientists from Delta Waterfowl and Iowa State University. Field operations will begin in April 2026 in Saskatchewan, and the graduate assistantship will formally begin at Iowa State University, Ames, IA, in August 2026.\n The assistantship is supported by a combination of teaching and research assistantships that provides a $28,800 per year stipend, health insurance, and a 75% tuition waiver.\n REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS \n• B.S. in ecology, wildlife biology, wildlife management, or a related discipline \n• Eligibility for admission to Iowa State University (including a GPA >3.0)\n• Demonstrated commitment to high-quality, collaborative scientific research\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS \n• Prior experience in movement ecology, avian ecology, or waterfowl nesting ecology \n• Experience with avian capture, safe handling procedures, or deployment of tracking transmitters \n• Ability to identify waterfowl species, particularly breeding hens \n• Proficiency in data management, statistical analysis, and movement-modeling frameworks \n• Strong interpersonal skills, with demonstrated ability to work independently and lead field crews under challenging conditions\n\nAPPLICATION DEADLINE: March 1, 2026 (applications will be reviewed as they are received)\nTo apply, please submit application materials (CV with contact information for 3 professional references, unofficial transcripts, and a cover letter describing career goals and professional interests) to https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2esiV8HjWy7oS3eF9SkcsbqDyMR12WYAkJQx4OOFVvBTeMA/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=106907810723402985289. \n For additional information contact:\nDr. Gunnar Kramer: grk@iastate.edu\nDr. Adam Janke: ajanke@iastate.edu\nDr. Jay VonBank: jvonbank@deltawaterfowl.org\n\nContact\nJay VonBank\njvonbank@deltawaterfowl.org (preferred contact method)",

Gerber (https://bgerber123.github.io/) at the Colorado Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and wildlife researchers at Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The graduate research assistantship will cover university tuition, fees, health coverage, and includes a pre-tax monthly pay of $3000/month. The position is expected to start Fall 2026 and be funded through December 2028.\n\nStudy Context: Sex and age class are important demographic parameters used in population modeling, in which the results help guide management decisions and annual harvest quotas of large mammals (e.g., elk, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, mule deer). This work will help develop new methodology and workflows that will aid Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s objective of producing robust empirical demographic data and population estimates for harvested wildlife. \n\nFocus: The focus of this study will be to collect data on the size distribution of elk sex and age classes (cow, calf, bull) to train and test a predictive approach using AI algorithms (developed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife) to classify animals from high-resolution aerial imagery. Field observations and size measurements (via 3D camera) will be collected to help test the accuracy of AI predictions. An additional avenue of exploration may be data collection and AI classification of sex/age class from camera trap images. The student will be expected to develop a project proposal outlining study objectives in coordination with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and a graduate committee at Colorado State University. The student will focus on technological and software workflows to meet study objectives, however, there will likely be field work opportunities as well (e.g., field observations, drone/aerial surveys). Given the trajectory of the wildlife field, the skills gained in this study will likely be desirable for future employers. \n\n Preferred Qualifications: \n\n-          Ungulate field research experience in the intermountain west\n-          Clear interest or experience developing data analysis workflows\n-          Clear interest or experience advancing technological innovation (hardware/software) in wildlife science\n-          Experience deploying camera traps and managing large data sets\n-          Experience with AI algorithms, for example MegaDetector or SpeciesNet\n \nMinimum Qualifications:\n-          A Bachelor of Science degree in wildlife ecology, biology, natural resource management, or related field\n-          A year or more of wildlife related professional research/work experience\n-          Strong writing skills\n-          Strong work ethic \n-          Desire to collaborate with state wildlife management agencies\n\nTo be considered, please send the following materials via email with “AI/Elk Application” as the subject line to Dr. Brian D.

The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: Aspergillus flavus, a common pathogen of maize globally, is especially problematic in the southeastern region of the United States. It causes ear-rot and contaminates grain with aflatoxin, a highly carcinogenic mycotoxin. Susceptibility to A. flavus infection and aflatoxin accumulation is exacerbated in the presence of biotic and abiotic stresses that commonly occur in corn production environments.

Deschutes County, Oregon represents the northwestern-most extent of the species range and lies far outside the extant range of pinyon pine species. Extensive treatments of juniper woodlands have been expedited throughout western states for restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, sage grouse habitat, and altered fire regimes. However, we lack clear understanding of how these treatments impact PIJA populations.  \n\nManagement priorities for PIJA in Oregon include assessing impacts of juniper treatments on PIJA and determining state-wide distribution. The primary goals of this project are to experimentally study how juniper treatments impact occupancy, habitat use, and nesting of PIJA on BLM lands in Deschutes County, Oregon. We are implementing a before-after-control-impact study and use bioacoustics monitoring, point counts, and nest searching methods. The MS project will focus on at least one component of the project. This work is in partnership with the East Cascades Bird Alliance, US Fish and Wildlife, and Deschutes BLM. We also contribute to the PIJA Western Working Group and the PIJA Conservation Action Strategy (CAS). The MS candidate will be expected to coordinate with and contribute findings to larger range-wide intiatives. \n\nLOCATION & PROGRAM: This position supports a student in the Masters of Science in Natural Resources at Oregon Tech in Klamath Falls, OR. Our MS program started in 2024 and is in the Natural Sciences Department, which also encompasses the MS of Medical Science program, and BS programs in Environmental Science and Biology-Health Science. Program description and requirements are here https://www.oit.edu/academics/degrees/natural-resources \n\nSUPPORT: This position includes the opportunity for a Graduate Teaching Assistantship for the Academic Years 2026-2026 and 2027-2028. The GTA will teach labs in the 200-level Principles of Biology series for majors, &/or similar courses within the students expertise. GTAs cover two 3-hour sections per term. Oregon Tech is on a quarter system. Fall, Winter, and Spring terms are 11 weeks. Our academic year runs from mid-September to Mid-June.  The GTA provides a per-term stipend and partial tuition remission during the academic year (Fall through Spring terms). In addition, this research assistantship will provide additional part-time stipend during the spring term, and full-time hourly salary over the summer. Some travel costs from Klamath Falls to Bend, OR will be covered. The graduate student will be expected to use their own vehicle, preferably one that can handle rugged, rocky roads to access field sites. If the student would prefer to forgo the GTA position and cover their own academic costs, that would be an option. \n\nPOSITION REQUIREMENTS: The candidate should have a Bachelors degree in Natural Resources, Wildlife, Ecology, Environmental Science or a closely related program of study and should meet the requirements for acceptance into the Masters of Natural Resources program at Oregon Tech. Ideally, the applicant will have at least 2 years of field experience studying birds, particularly nest searching and point counts. Experience with bioacoustics monitoring (ARUs, BirdNET) will be especially helpful. Additionally, experience doing habitat analyses (Occupancy modeling, RSFs, SDMs) using program R and GIS will be very valuable.  The candidate should have proven ability to work independently in remote areas, and as a member of a team, including supervising undergraduates and working with volunteers. \n\n \n\nDATES: Start date is flexible. We are beginning the greater project design and implementation this winter 2026, therefore, the candidate could start as early as March, 2026 as a temporary hire.

This resistance trait was identified and mapped in Solanum microdontum (Mcd) by its ability to protect tubers from bacterial soft rot disease.  There are three important questions that need to be addressed to prepare the germplasm for use in applied breeding programs:\n\nDoes Mcd resistance provide protection from other potato pathogens;\nDoes Mcd resistance provide protection to stems, leaves, and other tissues;\nWhat genes are responsible for Mcd resistance. \nFor additional background about this project see: doi: 10.1094/PHYTO-05-23-0158-R and doi: 10.1007/s12230-021-09859-8.  \n\nLearning Objectives: The postdoc will have the opportunity to learn advanced bacterial molecular genetics, biochemistry, next-generation sequencing methods and functional genomics, fluorescence microscopy, plant pathology, molecular plant-microbe interactions, and other skills related to developing an independent research program. The postdoc will be encouraged to attend professional conferences to present research results, participate in grant writing, and contribute to writing manuscripts. The research will take place in a USDA-ARS lab located in the Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology Section of Cornell University’s School of Integrative Plant Science, providing a dynamic and inspiring environment with a range of programs to support their professional development.\n\nMentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Bryan Swingle (bryan.swingle@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $73,000 annually.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS.

One of those openings will be devoted to assisting with the long-term monitoring of forest insects present in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF). \n\nStudents will work with research teams involving other undergraduate and graduate students, studying the biota and ecology of HBEF. The REU students will develop and conduct an independent research project under the supervision of their mentor. Many REU students continue their work as an independent study or senior honors thesis at their home institution. Additionally, through weekly on-site presentations given by the mentors and other scientists, students are also exposed to a full spectrum of ecosystem research at Hubbard Brook. The program runs from late May to mid-August. Students receive a stipend of $5500 for the 10-week program, as well as housing. Limited funding is available for research supplies and travel expenses. Students live at HBRF’s researcher housing adjacent to HBEF, among a community of summer field students and technicians. All residents are expected to share and cooperate with cleaning, cooking, and related chores.\n Lepidoptera / Forest insect community: This project aims to understand more about the Lepidoptera (moths and caterpillars) community, the most important herbivores in northern hardwood forests and a critical link from plant production to consumers like birds and bats. We will work with the insect-REU student to develop a project that may include elements such as building a photographic library of the moths and caterpillars within Hubbard Brook, collecting forest insect samples using various field methods, developing both manual and AI-assisted methods for identifying and enumerating moths (and other insect orders), as well as other research avenues to be determined by the student and mentors. Due to the Lepidoptera and forest insect work being closely linked to bird and bat research, the student will learn and participate in long-term bird research including nest searching and counting food availability, as well as participate in bat research and bioacoustics monitoring. Through this opportunity, the student will have ample access to a multitude of research questions to explore and a chance to contribute to new knowledge in forest ecosystem dynamics.\n In your application, please include: a letter explaining why a summer research project interests you and how it fits into your broader plans, your resume and email contact for two references (they do not need to submit letters). Applications are due by March 6.\n\nIf interested in the position, please send your application to Dr. Matt Ayres (Dartmouth College: matthew.p.ayres@dartmouth.edu) and Jessica Jones (Dartmouth College: jessica.s.jones.gr@dartmouth.edu). \n\nContact\nJessica Jones\njessica.s.jones.gr@dartmouth.edu (preferred contact method)",

Its primary purpose is to serve the original needs of the NGO’s operations which are wildlife conservation through research and education. This is accomplished through the layout of the farm which provides extensive wildlife habitat and foraging opportunities, increasing the local faunal biodiversity as well as acting as an educational demonstration to local subsistence farmers and visiting students.  \n  Interns will learn by assisting in implementation and evaluation of management practices, cropping, and record keeping on the farm with this vision in mind while we endeavor to maximize the products coming from the farm with the existing design and layout using sustainable and regenerative practices specific to the Mesoamerican uplands. Within this broad framework, intern projects can include several basic Agricultural Education disciplines including Tropical Agriculture, Sustainable/organic Agriculture, Farm Management, Waste management, and Agricultural Economics.  \n  In addition to planting crops, we also have free range chickens and ducks for eggs and meat. We are looking to increase our revenue generation from the farm either in the form of increased accountable products entering our kitchen for use in our restaurant, or for sale to the Mobile Market or in a proposed road-side café which would be managed by T.R.E.E.S kitchen and hospitality staff. Thus, interns would also assist us with our marketing strategy for existing products and/or planting. \n  By the successful conclusion of this internship, the student will be able to apply practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species, basic free range poultry operations, evaluate different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns, and become familiar with sustainable management practices such as no/low till, cover cropping, waste management, mulching, marketing, Farm-to-Table, etc. \n    Requirements: \n No prior tropical agriculture experience required. Interns can be current undergraduate or graduate students enrolled in a program with their University/College for credit, however non-students can also apply; but preference will be given to students enrolled in an accreditation program. Experienced tropical agriculturalists and/or agroforestry professionals are also welcome and will be treated according to their experience level and are eligible for *discounted rates. \n    Internship Responsibilities: \n Applying practical methods for planting and maintaining various typical and exotic tropical crop species and basic free range poultry operations. \nEvaluating different treatments using objective measurements of biomass, yield, and costs/returns. \nWork on Inga Alley-cropping and other regenerative cropping practices, and using intercropping, organic fertilizing and pest control practices. \nAssist with innovative marketing strategies for existing products accompanied by reviewing projected budgets for the farm and their products and exploring cost/profit ratios for poultry husbandry. \nPlanting and selling new products for the farm. \nOpportunities are also available to observe and participate with concurrent intern and wildlife educational activities such as mist-netting, observing and recording measurements of bats, birds, herps, invertebrates, water quality, and much more. \nInterns will assist with creating captions for social media posts to engage and update followers on what has been going on at the field station and various projects that are being done. \n     Costs: \n The internship fee includes room and board (meals included Monday-Friday), full access to lab equipment, and training by professional on-site biologists. Food is a combination of self-catering in a communal kitchen with ingredients provided as well as prepared meals, depending on whether we have other groups on site. Lodging at the research center signifies a shared dormitory-style rustic cabins with other same sex interns. This comes with full access to other facilities such as showers, restrooms, and kitchen. The nature of this program allows interns to carry out most of the work independently after the training period is done. Fees do not include airport transfer, flights, travel medical insurance, or $100 USD visitor permit fee if remaining in country for more than 30 days.    \n  We are hoping to expand our internship program beyond North America. Citizens from Latin America and the Caribbean will be charged at a discounted rate of 50%. Belizeans will get another discount. For more information, kindly email Scandia Cruz with the email provided above. \n    Schedule: \n Interns are required to work for 35 hours/week minimum. The typical schedule runs from Monday through Friday, from 6:30 am until 12:30 pm and 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm. Weekends are free time for interns; therefore, you can do as please (travel, hike, relax). No refunds on food and lodging will be available if the intern decides to leave the station. Projects may sometimes run into the weekend; in which case the days will be returned to them during the week. The intern supervisor(s) will be responsible for designing a schedule with the intern each week that is reasonable and includes work on the various projects. \n  Application:  \n For more information on our organization and facilities please visit our website: www.treesociety.org.
