The two graduate students will work together and supervise undergraduates in the field and laboratory to \n1. Assess soil physicochemical properties and microbial activities under repeated prescribed fires and forest thinning \n2. Analyze existing, multi-decadal vegetation and litter data to explore plant-soil-microbe interactions in a changing environment \n3. Examine the impact of microplastic pollution on soil nutrients and microbes. \n\nThe hired students are expected to join and lead a three-week field campaign in summer 2026. The team will travel to multiple field sites and research stations in the southeast (AL, GA, NC, SC) to collect and pre-process soil and litter samples. Samples will be brought or shipped back to AU for further laboratory analysis. Students are welcome to build their projects within the scope of soil health and nutrient cycling.  \n Responsibilities \n1. Conduct literature reviews and learn/develop experimental protocols \n2. Attend weekly or biweekly lab meetings to share updates and give comments \n3. Generate, organize, and analyze data \n4. Write and publish manuscripts in peer-reviewed scientific journals \n5. Present research findings at local, national, and international conferences \n Minimum Qualifications \n1. BS degree in Forestry, Ecology, Environmental Science, Natural Resources, or a related field; MS degree is required if applying for PhD \n2.

We integrate field measurements, laboratory experiments, and computational statistics to examine soil biogeochemical responses under warmer climate, shifted precipitation regimes, and disturbances in forest ecosystems. The lab consists of a main laboratory room, a soil texture room, two storage rooms with field equipment, and a shared walk-in refrigerator. The main laboratory room houses a Biological Digital Microscope, a Deionized Water System, a Shimadzu Total Organic Carbon Analyzer, an Electronic Thermostat Hova-Bator Incubator, an Isotemp Programmable Muffle Furnace, a Chloroform fumigation-extraction station, and a brand-new FlashSmart Elemental Analyzer.\n\nVisit Dr. Yang’s profile to learn more about the lab and research activities. Information regarding PhD and MS programs in the college of Forestry, Wildlife and Environment can be found at https://cfwe.auburn.edu/graduate-study/graduate-degrees/. \n To Apply\nPlease email the following materials as a single PDF document to Dr. Yang Yang at yangy@auburn.edu, with the subject line “Potential Graduate Student at AU.” \n1. A cover letter (1 page max) outlining the research interests, relevant experience, and professional goals \n2. Resume/CV and contact information only from three professional references \n3. Unofficial transcripts \n\nApplications will be reviewed on a rolling basis and accepted through August 31, 2025.
