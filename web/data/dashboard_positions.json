Hares have been studied for >40 years on-site, and this new work will investigate the role of food and vegetative structure on hare behavioural repertoires in the context of their 10-year population cycles. Hares live on a fine edge between risk of predation/starvation vs. sustainable nutrition, setting the stage for critical behavioural tradeoffs though space and time. Using archived as well as new GPS telemetry and accelerometry data, combined with assays of structural cover and food availability/quality from remote sensing, the project will address some of the following questions: 1) Whether hares adjust movements and feeding behaviours in response to variation in food and cover, and 2) If hare responses are fine-tuned according to cyclic population dynamics and corresponding variation in predation risk and conspecific density. It is uncertain how hares survive on low-quality woody browse and limited shrub cover during winter, setting the stage for using hyperspectral imaging and LiDAR to help develop: 3) Maps of hare nutritional/structural cover landscapes through space and time, and 4) Relating hare behaviours to these complex, variable environments. Additional remote sensing using ground penetrating radar (GPR) can further support these efforts by: 5) Addressing the role of local snow conditions (depth, hardness) on food/cover availability, and corresponding hare responses through the winter season. Data resulting from such research could support dynamic models exploring how hares respond to environmental variation under climate change.

For decades our team studied vertebrates in the boreal forest ecosystem in the region, and we are now extending this  work to address pressing questions related to vegetation and snow dynamics in this rapidly-changing northern landscape. Using an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with LiDAR, multispectral, and RGB sensors, and combined with archived satellite data for the region, the PhD student may investigate some of the following questions: 1) Patterns of forest productivity, regeneration, and phenology across space and time, and 2) Sources of forest structural heterogeneity and resilience to insect outbreaks or fire. A high priority is to understand how the boreal forest may be impacted by climate change, which can be accomplished by: 3) Combining and back-casting remote sensing products to predict past changes to forest structural cover and deciduous vegetation composition (shrubification). Likewise, we are interested in understanding how variable snow conditions may affect winter forest dynamics and ecology of terrestrial mammals by: 4) Using ground penetrating radar and LiDAR to identify the determinants of local snow conditions (hardness, density). Ultimately, these investigations can lead to: 5) Forecasts of future boreal forest and snow dynamics under IPCC climate change scenarios.

The successful applicant will begin in the Fall 2026 semester.\n\nRio Grande cutthroat trout (RGCT) are the southernmost species of cutthroat trout and have experienced a severe decline in both range and abundance, now occupying only ~12 percent of its historical distribution and requires targeted management interventions to support recovery. Major components of the recovery plan detail the need to secure extant populations and reintroduce individuals within their native range in Colorado and New Mexico. Recent efforts to date include development of a multi-source, genetically diverse broodstock for the Rio Grande basin that is used for reintroduction efforts.\n\nIndividuals from this multi-source broodstock were stocked at multiple sites throughout the recently restored Rio Costilla watershed which represents one of the largest native fish restoration projects in the country. While recent research has shown that this composite broodstock is more genetically diverse compared to using single source populations there is a need to evaluate how these fish are performing in the wild. The present project has a number of goals:\n\n          1. Evaluate genetic structure and diversity of reintroduced Rio Costilla RGCT populations\n                     a. There is also opportunity to develop questions with demographic monitoring data in this system.\n          2. Genetic assessment of Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos basins. \n                     a. Results will help inform multi-source broodstock development for Canadian & Pecos basins and identify additional source populations for Rio Grande basin.\n                     b. Results will also provide an updated genetic assessment for RGCT.\n          3. There are additional opportunities for the student to develop their own questions using genetic and demographic data.\n\nThis project is a collaborative effort funded by the New Mexico Department of Wildlife and there may be potential to collaborate with other university researchers and agencies. Benefits include a salary range of ~$28-29k/year, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance. Funding will also be available for conference travel, workshop training for data analyses, and safety training (e.g., wilderness first aid). The hired candidate will begin in Fall 2026 and will be based at NMSU in Las Cruces, NM.\n\nHow to apply: If interested, please compile the following: (1) a statement of interest that describes your educational and research background, as well as your research interests and how this position fits in your career goals (2) curriculum vitae or resume, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts compiled in a single PDF and save as ‘Lastname_RGCT_PhD.pdf’.  Applicants are also asked to upload a writing sample in the application portal. Applications should be submitted through the airtable linked here:  https://airtable.com/app3jNqbQZsYstwx7/pagrpU5GqaI6FnSTg/form \n\nApplications are due 03/18/26 by 11:59p MT. You can learn more about the Pregler Lab at https://preglerlab.com and any questions about the position can be sent to Dr. Kasey Pregler at kpregler@nmsu.edu.   \n\nQualifications: \n\nRequired: B.S. in fisheries, biology, or related field and possession of a valid U.S. driver’s license. The successful applicant must also meet the minimum requirements for admission to the NMSU Graduate School (3.0 GPA in last two years of undergrad).

Gerber (https://bgerber123.github.io/) at the Colorado Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit and wildlife researchers at Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The graduate research assistantship will cover university tuition, fees, health coverage, and includes a pre-tax monthly pay of $3000/month. The position is expected to start Fall 2026 and be funded through December 2028.\n\nStudy Context: Sex and age class are important demographic parameters used in population modeling, in which the results help guide management decisions and annual harvest quotas of large mammals (e.g., elk, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, mule deer). This work will help develop new methodology and workflows that will aid Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s objective of producing robust empirical demographic data and population estimates for harvested wildlife. \n\nFocus: The focus of this study will be to collect data on the size distribution of elk sex and age classes (cow, calf, bull) to train and test a predictive approach using AI algorithms (developed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife) to classify animals from high-resolution aerial imagery. Field observations and size measurements (via 3D camera) will be collected to help test the accuracy of AI predictions. An additional avenue of exploration may be data collection and AI classification of sex/age class from camera trap images. The student will be expected to develop a project proposal outlining study objectives in coordination with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and a graduate committee at Colorado State University. The student will focus on technological and software workflows to meet study objectives, however, there will likely be field work opportunities as well (e.g., field observations, drone/aerial surveys). Given the trajectory of the wildlife field, the skills gained in this study will likely be desirable for future employers. \n\n Preferred Qualifications: \n\n-          Ungulate field research experience in the intermountain west\n-          Clear interest or experience developing data analysis workflows\n-          Clear interest or experience advancing technological innovation (hardware/software) in wildlife science\n-          Experience deploying camera traps and managing large data sets\n-          Experience with AI algorithms, for example MegaDetector or SpeciesNet\n \nMinimum Qualifications:\n-          A Bachelor of Science degree in wildlife ecology, biology, natural resource management, or related field\n-          A year or more of wildlife related professional research/work experience\n-          Strong writing skills\n-          Strong work ethic \n-          Desire to collaborate with state wildlife management agencies\n\nTo be considered, please send the following materials via email with “AI/Elk Application” as the subject line to Dr. Brian D. Gerber (brian.gerber@colostate.edu) by March 2, 2026: 1) Cover letter outlining career goals, academic interests, and relevant experience related to the minimum and preferred qualifications, 2) resume with contact information for 3-4 personal references, and unofficial copy of B.S. transcripts. \n\nContact\nBrian D.

Deschutes County, Oregon represents the northwestern-most extent of the species range and lies far outside the extant range of pinyon pine species. Extensive treatments of juniper woodlands have been expedited throughout western states for restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, sage grouse habitat, and altered fire regimes. However, we lack clear understanding of how these treatments impact PIJA populations.  \n\nManagement priorities for PIJA in Oregon include assessing impacts of juniper treatments on PIJA and determining state-wide distribution. The primary goals of this project are to experimentally study how juniper treatments impact occupancy, habitat use, and nesting of PIJA on BLM lands in Deschutes County, Oregon. We are implementing a before-after-control-impact study and use bioacoustics monitoring, point counts, and nest searching methods. The MS project will focus on at least one component of the project. This work is in partnership with the East Cascades Bird Alliance, US Fish and Wildlife, and Deschutes BLM. We also contribute to the PIJA Western Working Group and the PIJA Conservation Action Strategy (CAS). The MS candidate will be expected to coordinate with and contribute findings to larger range-wide intiatives. \n\nLOCATION & PROGRAM: This position supports a student in the Masters of Science in Natural Resources at Oregon Tech in Klamath Falls, OR. Our MS program started in 2024 and is in the Natural Sciences Department, which also encompasses the MS of Medical Science program, and BS programs in Environmental Science and Biology-Health Science. Program description and requirements are here https://www.oit.edu/academics/degrees/natural-resources \n\nSUPPORT: This position includes the opportunity for a Graduate Teaching Assistantship for the Academic Years 2026-2026 and 2027-2028. The GTA will teach labs in the 200-level Principles of Biology series for majors, &/or similar courses within the students expertise. GTAs cover two 3-hour sections per term. Oregon Tech is on a quarter system. Fall, Winter, and Spring terms are 11 weeks. Our academic year runs from mid-September to Mid-June.  The GTA provides a per-term stipend and partial tuition remission during the academic year (Fall through Spring terms). In addition, this research assistantship will provide additional part-time stipend during the spring term, and full-time hourly salary over the summer. Some travel costs from Klamath Falls to Bend, OR will be covered. The graduate student will be expected to use their own vehicle, preferably one that can handle rugged, rocky roads to access field sites. If the student would prefer to forgo the GTA position and cover their own academic costs, that would be an option. \n\nPOSITION REQUIREMENTS: The candidate should have a Bachelors degree in Natural Resources, Wildlife, Ecology, Environmental Science or a closely related program of study and should meet the requirements for acceptance into the Masters of Natural Resources program at Oregon Tech. Ideally, the applicant will have at least 2 years of field experience studying birds, particularly nest searching and point counts. Experience with bioacoustics monitoring (ARUs, BirdNET) will be especially helpful. Additionally, experience doing habitat analyses (Occupancy modeling, RSFs, SDMs) using program R and GIS will be very valuable.  The candidate should have proven ability to work independently in remote areas, and as a member of a team, including supervising undergraduates and working with volunteers. \n\n \n\nDATES: Start date is flexible.

Specific aspects of the study will include the construction of a user-friendly, ArcGIS online decision support tool for prioritizing areas for reforestation that will maximize co-benefits for waterfowl. The position carries an annual stipend of $20,000 plus tuition waiver. Expected start date of May or August 2026. \n Project Description: Bottomland hardwood forests are under extreme and accelerated pressure from anthropogenic and environmental stressors, subsequently impact many ecological processes including the degradation of habitat quality for forested wetland dependent waterfowl. The extent of historical loss from drainage and agricultural conversion; degradation of forest health from insects and disease; shifts in tree species composition from water stress, and excessive declines in abundance of wintering waterfowl in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley are overwhelmingly documented. Thus, restoration and reforestation effects are of utmost priority in the region and newly emerging carbon credit markets may provide the catalyst needed to accelerate reforestation in the region to improve habitat suitability for wintering mallards. The purpose of this project is to provide guidance for carbon-based reforestation efforts to maximize the co-benefits for waterfowl.   \n Requirements: Applicants must have a 2.7 overall undergraduate GPA or 3.0 GPA in the last 60 semester hours of undergraduate courses. Also required a B.S. degree in geospatial sciences, geography, wildlife management/conservation, or related field, while experiences with waterfowl, GIS, remote sensing, data science, and landscape ecology are preferred. Applicants must have a valid U.S. driver’s license or obtain the same within 60 days of starting employment.

Opportunity: Riparian restoration tools in working grasslands\nThe Genomics, Ecology, and Modeling for Conservation Lab at North Dakota State University, led by Travis Seaborn, is recruiting for one M.S. position to join our team working on a recently funded project in collaboration with the Albert K. Ekre Grassland Preserve. For more information on the preserve see: https://ndsufoundation.com/magazine/2021/09/ekre-grassland-preserve. \n Anticipated start date: Summer 2026. Stiped ~$25,000 for 2-3 years. Tuition waiver also provided.\n The overall project will advance our ability to understand community responses to riparian restoration. Riparian ecosystems in the Northern Great Plains have been heavily altered by anthropogenic activities. Although there are numerous restoration options for riparian ecosystems, a common and effective restoration practice, in particular in incised stream systems, are beaver dam analogs. Using streams at the Ekre Grassland Preserve and nearby public land, we will be looking to do a restoration project using invasive buckthorn woody materials. To achieve this, we are beginning to plan a Before-After-Control-Impact design to assess riparian and floodplain ecosystem responses, including geomorphology, biological community, and water quality. Much of the beaver dam analog research that has been done has occurred in the western United States, and response to these activities in the Northern Great Plains is unknown. Surveys of the biological community may include electrofishing and minnow trapping for fish, camera traps for mammals, visual and auditory surveys for birds, and plant identification along transects.\n The primary goals of this position include:\n1.    Identify the impact of beaver dam analogs.\n2.    Using geographic information systems, develop beaver species distribution models for the region.\n To apply: Please email travis.seaborn@ndsu.edu a letter of interest, which should include an explanation of fit and past relevant experience, and CV by February 20th.\nContact\nTravis Seaborn\n2537973130\ntravis.seaborn@ndsu.edu (preferred contact method)",

Our research program focuses on understanding how plants perceive and adapt to adverse environmental conditions, with the ultimate goal of protecting crops and mitigating damage caused by environmental stress.\n\nTomato will be used as the primary research model, as it is both one of the most important vegetable crops worldwide and an excellent model plant for environmental science research. Students will grow tomato plants in our greenhouse, harvest fruits at the mature green stage, and store them under different temperature conditions to investigate the effects of heat stress on fruit ripening.\n\nProject 1: Stable Carbon Isotope Fractionation and Fruit Respiration\nOne student will focus on developing a novel approach using stable carbon isotope fractionation to monitor the effects of heat stress on fruit respiration pathways, which are closely linked to fruit productivity. Although stable isotope fractionation is widely used in geochemistry, it has rarely been applied to the study of fruit ripening. This approach will provide a multidimensional perspective on how heat stress influences fruit respiratory metabolism. This project includes a collaboration with Rice University, where the student will spend approximately one week each year conducting specialized isotope measurements.\n\nProject 2: Role of Abscisic Acid (ABA) in Heat Stress Tolerance\nThe second student will investigate the role of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) in tomato plant development and fruit ripening, with a particular focus on its involvement in heat stress responses and resistance mechanisms. This project will compare wild-type tomatoes with mutant lines that have reduced or enhanced ABA accumulation in fruits, with the goal of understanding how ABA influences fruit survival under heat stress conditions.\n\nThrough two years of research training, students will gain a strong foundation in the concepts and techniques of environmental stress research, develop proficiency with relevant laboratory and greenhouse instrumentation, and acquire skills essential for careers in environmental science research, agricultural chemistry, and environmental monitoring.\n\nFunding and Qualifications\nProspective students with an interest in agricultural chemistry are encouraged to apply. Students will be supported as teaching assistants, receiving a $15,000 annual stipend and $7,000 in tuition remission, distributed equally across the three academic terms.\n\nApplicants should have a bachelor’s degree in chemistry, biology, agriculture, environmental science, or a related discipline, along with strong written and verbal communication skills and the ability to work both independently and as part of a research team.\n\nApplication Process\nApplications will be reviewed on a rolling basis, with the position closing on March 31, 2026.
