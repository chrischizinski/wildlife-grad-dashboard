    "description": "PhD assistantship: Rio Grande cutthroat trout conservation and genetics\nNew Mexico State University (State)\nDetails\nApplication Deadline:\n03/18/2026\nPublished:\n02/18/2026\nStarting Date:\n8/17/2026\nHours per Week:\nat least 20\nSalary:\n$28,384 to $29,041 per year\nEducation Required:\nBachelors\nExperience Required:\nnone\nLocation:\nNew Mexico State University (Las Cruces, New Mexico)\nTags:\nGraduate Opportunities\nDescription\nRIO GRANDE CUTTHROAT TROUT PHD ASSISTANTSHIP\n\nDescription & project background: \n\nThe Pregler Lab at New Mexico State University in the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Ecology invites applications for a PhD research assistantship focused on Rio Grande cutthroat trout conservation. The successful applicant will begin in the Fall 2026 semester.\n\nRio Grande cutthroat trout (RGCT) are the southernmost species of cutthroat trout and have experienced a severe decline in both range and abundance, now occupying only ~12 percent of its historical distribution and requires targeted management interventions to support recovery. Major components of the recovery plan detail the need to secure extant populations and reintroduce individuals within their native range in Colorado and New Mexico. Recent efforts to date include development of a multi-source, genetically diverse broodstock for the Rio Grande basin that is used for reintroduction efforts.\n\nIndividuals from this multi-source broodstock were stocked at multiple sites throughout the recently restored Rio Costilla watershed which represents one of the largest native fish restoration projects in the country. While recent research has shown that this composite broodstock is more genetically diverse compared to using single source populations there is a need to evaluate how these fish are performing in the wild. The present project has a number of goals:\n\n          1. Evaluate genetic structure and diversity of reintroduced Rio Costilla RGCT populations\n                     a. There is also opportunity to develop questions with demographic monitoring data in this system.\n          2. Genetic assessment of Rio Grande, Canadian, and Pecos basins. \n                     a. Results will help inform multi-source broodstock development for Canadian & Pecos basins and identify additional source populations for Rio Grande basin.\n                     b. Results will also provide an updated genetic assessment for RGCT.\n          3. There are additional opportunities for the student to develop their own questions using genetic and demographic data.\n\nThis project is a collaborative effort funded by the New Mexico Department of Wildlife and there may be potential to collaborate with other university researchers and agencies. Benefits include a salary range of ~$28-29k/year, full tuition waiver, and subsidized health insurance. Funding will also be available for conference travel, workshop training for data analyses, and safety training (e.g., wilderness first aid). The hired candidate will begin in Fall 2026 and will be based at NMSU in Las Cruces, NM.\n\nHow to apply: If interested, please compile the following: (1) a statement of interest that describes your educational and research background, as well as your research interests and how this position fits in your career goals (2) curriculum vitae or resume, (3) contact information for three professional references, and (4) unofficial transcripts compiled in a single PDF and save as ‘Lastname_RGCT_PhD.pdf’.  Applicants are also asked to upload a writing sample in the application portal. Applications should be submitted through the airtable linked here:  https://airtable.com/app3jNqbQZsYstwx7/pagrpU5GqaI6FnSTg/form \n\nApplications are due 03/18/26 by 11:59p MT. You can learn more about the Pregler Lab at https://preglerlab.com and any questions about the position can be sent to Dr. Kasey Pregler at kpregler@nmsu.edu.   \n\nQualifications: \n\nRequired: B.S. in fisheries, biology, or related field and possession of a valid U.S. driver’s license. The successful applicant must also meet the minimum requirements for admission to the NMSU Graduate School (3.0 GPA in last two years of undergrad). Applicants should also have demonstrated excellent written and oral communication skills, and an ability to work independently. \n\nPreference will be given to applicants with an M.S. degree in fisheries, biology, or related field and have experience working in the backcountry and are willing to lead field work crews in backcountry conditions.\n\nSuccessful candidates will have proficiency in R, and an interest in genetics and working with large datasets.

The position is expected to start Fall 2026 and be funded through December 2028.\n\nStudy Context: Sex and age class are important demographic parameters used in population modeling, in which the results help guide management decisions and annual harvest quotas of large mammals (e.g., elk, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, mule deer). This work will help develop new methodology and workflows that will aid Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s objective of producing robust empirical demographic data and population estimates for harvested wildlife. \n\nFocus: The focus of this study will be to collect data on the size distribution of elk sex and age classes (cow, calf, bull) to train and test a predictive approach using AI algorithms (developed by Colorado Parks and Wildlife) to classify animals from high-resolution aerial imagery. Field observations and size measurements (via 3D camera) will be collected to help test the accuracy of AI predictions. An additional avenue of exploration may be data collection and AI classification of sex/age class from camera trap images. The student will be expected to develop a project proposal outlining study objectives in coordination with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and a graduate committee at Colorado State University. The student will focus on technological and software workflows to meet study objectives, however, there will likely be field work opportunities as well (e.g., field observations, drone/aerial surveys).

The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: Aspergillus flavus, a common pathogen of maize globally, is especially problematic in the southeastern region of the United States. It causes ear-rot and contaminates grain with aflatoxin, a highly carcinogenic mycotoxin. Susceptibility to A. flavus infection and aflatoxin accumulation is exacerbated in the presence of biotic and abiotic stresses that commonly occur in corn production environments. Since inheritance of resistance to Aspergillus ear rot is controlled by many QTL across the genome, innovative research will be required to develop and deploy commercially valuable hybrids possessing stable resistance. The fellow will be involved in a research project to\n\nScreen and characterize maize germplasm from different sources to identify germplasm with resistance to Aspergillus flavus kernel infection and subsequent aflatoxin accumulation;\nIncorporate resistance to A. flavus into agronomically acceptable maize inbred lines with improved combining ability for yield, and alignment with industry heterotic patterns; and\nDiscover maize inbred lines that are resilient to extreme weather events and more productive under sustainable management systems.\nLearning Objectives: The participant will gain skills in laboratory methodologies, experimental design, maize breeding, and data analysis.

Deschutes County, Oregon represents the northwestern-most extent of the species range and lies far outside the extant range of pinyon pine species. Extensive treatments of juniper woodlands have been expedited throughout western states for restoration of sagebrush ecosystems, sage grouse habitat, and altered fire regimes. However, we lack clear understanding of how these treatments impact PIJA populations.  \n\nManagement priorities for PIJA in Oregon include assessing impacts of juniper treatments on PIJA and determining state-wide distribution. The primary goals of this project are to experimentally study how juniper treatments impact occupancy, habitat use, and nesting of PIJA on BLM lands in Deschutes County, Oregon. We are implementing a before-after-control-impact study and use bioacoustics monitoring, point counts, and nest searching methods. The MS project will focus on at least one component of the project. This work is in partnership with the East Cascades Bird Alliance, US Fish and Wildlife, and Deschutes BLM. We also contribute to the PIJA Western Working Group and the PIJA Conservation Action Strategy (CAS). The MS candidate will be expected to coordinate with and contribute findings to larger range-wide intiatives. \n\nLOCATION & PROGRAM: This position supports a student in the Masters of Science in Natural Resources at Oregon Tech in Klamath Falls, OR. Our MS program started in 2024 and is in the Natural Sciences Department, which also encompasses the MS of Medical Science program, and BS programs in Environmental Science and Biology-Health Science. Program description and requirements are here https://www.oit.edu/academics/degrees/natural-resources \n\nSUPPORT: This position includes the opportunity for a Graduate Teaching Assistantship for the Academic Years 2026-2026 and 2027-2028. The GTA will teach labs in the 200-level Principles of Biology series for majors, &/or similar courses within the students expertise. GTAs cover two 3-hour sections per term. Oregon Tech is on a quarter system. Fall, Winter, and Spring terms are 11 weeks. Our academic year runs from mid-September to Mid-June.  The GTA provides a per-term stipend and partial tuition remission during the academic year (Fall through Spring terms). In addition, this research assistantship will provide additional part-time stipend during the spring term, and full-time hourly salary over the summer. Some travel costs from Klamath Falls to Bend, OR will be covered. The graduate student will be expected to use their own vehicle, preferably one that can handle rugged, rocky roads to access field sites. If the student would prefer to forgo the GTA position and cover their own academic costs, that would be an option. \n\nPOSITION REQUIREMENTS: The candidate should have a Bachelors degree in Natural Resources, Wildlife, Ecology, Environmental Science or a closely related program of study and should meet the requirements for acceptance into the Masters of Natural Resources program at Oregon Tech. Ideally, the applicant will have at least 2 years of field experience studying birds, particularly nest searching and point counts. Experience with bioacoustics monitoring (ARUs, BirdNET) will be especially helpful. Additionally, experience doing habitat analyses (Occupancy modeling, RSFs, SDMs) using program R and GIS will be very valuable.  The candidate should have proven ability to work independently in remote areas, and as a member of a team, including supervising undergraduates and working with volunteers. \n\n \n\nDATES: Start date is flexible. We are beginning the greater project design and implementation this winter 2026, therefore, the candidate could start as early as March, 2026 as a temporary hire.
