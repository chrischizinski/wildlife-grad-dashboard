The largest research theme within Transforming Climate Action is Reducing Uncertainties in Carbon Cycling in the Northwest Atlantic Seas (Uncertain Seas). The goal of Uncertain Seas is to better constrain the role of the ocean in the Earth’s climate system by reducing uncertainties with physical and biogeochemical processes that control the global ocean carbon cycle. The focus is on the Northwest Atlantic gateway as a major contributor to ocean carbon uptake and sequestration, particularly with respect to the biological carbon pump.\nWe are seeking a PhD Student to estimate carbon fluxes in the Northwest Atlantic from Earth system and ecosystem models.

The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: The US National Poultry Research Center (USNPRC) is seeking a postdoctoral fellow to investigate the complex molecular interactions between Infectious Laryngotracheitis Virus (ILTV) and the host immune system. As an alphaherpesvirus, ILTV causes significant economic losses worldwide through respiratory distress and decreased production in poultry. This research specifically focuses on the characterization of virus-encoded immunoregulatory proteins, known as virokines, which serve as evolved mechanisms allowing the virus to subvert or evade the host’s innate and adaptive immune responses. By utilizing synthetic biology and reverse genetics, the participant will dissect the function of these proteins to identify targets for attenuation, ultimately leveraging these insights to engineer next-generation vaccine candidates using viral-vector platforms to bridge the gap between fundamental virology and applied veterinary medicine.\n\nResearch activities will include the characterization of novel ILTV-encoded virokines to determine their specific cellular targets within the avian immune system and develop novel vaccines. The fellow will determine the role of these immunomodulatory proteins in viral replication and pathogenesis using both in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, the project involves utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 and recombineering to generate mutant viruses lacking specific virokines to assess their potential as live-attenuated vaccine candidates. To ensure rigorous evaluation, the participant will establish standardized immunological assays to define the correlates of protection, focusing on both mucosal and systemic cellular responses.

ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nhttps://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/ithaca-ny/robert-w-holley-center-for-agriculture-health/emerging-pests-and-pathogens-research/\n\nResearch Project: The Emerging Pests and Pathogens Research Unit (EPPRU) is seeking a motivated Post Doctoral fellow to participate in a multi-disciplinary research program focused on the molecular biology of plant pathogenic bacteria. Projects within this research unit are generally aimed at solving questions related to the biology of plant pathogens and cover a range of applied and fundamental research topics. The research opportunities for this postdoc will be centered around investigating a new source of genetic disease resistance in potatoes. This resistance trait was identified and mapped in Solanum microdontum (Mcd) by its ability to protect tubers from bacterial soft rot disease.  There are three important questions that need to be addressed to prepare the germplasm for use in applied breeding programs:\n\nDoes Mcd resistance provide protection from other potato pathogens;\nDoes Mcd resistance provide protection to stems, leaves, and other tissues;\nWhat genes are responsible for Mcd resistance. \nFor additional background about this project see: doi: 10.1094/PHYTO-05-23-0158-R and doi: 10.1007/s12230-021-09859-8.  \n\nLearning Objectives: The postdoc will have the opportunity to learn advanced bacterial molecular genetics, biochemistry, next-generation sequencing methods and functional genomics, fluorescence microscopy, plant pathology, molecular plant-microbe interactions, and other skills related to developing an independent research program. The postdoc will be encouraged to attend professional conferences to present research results, participate in grant writing, and contribute to writing manuscripts. The research will take place in a USDA-ARS lab located in the Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology Section of Cornell University’s School of Integrative Plant Science, providing a dynamic and inspiring environment with a range of programs to support their professional development.\n\nMentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Bryan Swingle (bryan.swingle@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: 2026. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year, but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend is $73,000 annually.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\n\nQuestions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process, please email ORISE.ARS.Northeast@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.\n\nQualifications\nThe qualified candidate should be currently pursuing or have received a doctoral degree in the one of the relevant fields (e.g. (Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology, Plant Pathology, Microbiology, Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, or similar)). Degree must have been received within the past five years or is anticipated to be received by 6/1/2026.\n\nPreferred skills:\n\nCandidates with a track record of publication in peer-reviewed journals, grant writing, and delivering oral presentations are highly desirable.\n  Contact\nUSDA-ARS-NEA-2026-0021\ncontact via the web posting is preferred (see Details section)",
