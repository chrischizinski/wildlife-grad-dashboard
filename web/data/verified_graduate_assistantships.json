The largest research theme within Transforming Climate Action is Reducing Uncertainties in Carbon Cycling in the Northwest Atlantic Seas (Uncertain Seas). The goal of Uncertain Seas is to better constrain the role of the ocean in the Earth’s climate system by reducing uncertainties with physical and biogeochemical processes that control the global ocean carbon cycle. The focus is on the Northwest Atlantic gateway as a major contributor to ocean carbon uptake and sequestration, particularly with respect to the biological carbon pump.\nWe are seeking a PhD Student to estimate carbon fluxes in the Northwest Atlantic from Earth system and ecosystem models. As a part of Transforming Climate Action, there will be opportunities to participate in workshops with other graduate students from the four institutions. There will also be opportunities for research visits to collaborating labs and conference travel. There may be opportunities to participate in research expeditions, although not a requirement.  \n\nLocation: The student will be enrolled in the PhD in Fisheries Science graduate program at the Fisheries & Marine Institute, Memorial University, in St. John’s, NL, Canada.  Memorial University is a hub of ocean sciences located in the Province’s capital.
