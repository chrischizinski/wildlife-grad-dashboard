Hunters participate directly in the natural world and care enough to make sure that it continues in all of its awesome beauty and diversity.\n\nSafari Club International (SCI) is a U.S.-based organization of more than 50,000 hunters and nearly 200 chapters worldwide, dedicated to protecting the right to hunt and to promote wildlife conservation. Between SCI and its sister organization, the SCI Foundation, we have put more than $70 Million on the ground for conservation since 2000. In the U.S. and abroad, hunters are part of a system that keeps the rivers, forests and fields intact and maintains the wildlife.\n\nSafari Club International Foundation (SCIF) has a 20-year history of being a leader in science-based, research-driven solutions to real problems facing wildlife conservation and sustainable use of wildlife resources. SCIF is active in domestic and international wildlife conservation, including with CITES and the IUCN, and is the host of the annual African Wildlife Consultative Forum. We partner with leading wildlife researchers at places like the Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Auburn University, and Michigan State University to bring the latest applied techniques to wildlife conservation issues.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Safari Club International Foundation (SCIF) is seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Fellow to support SCIF’s research on large carnivores in Africa and North America. The candidate should have a Ph.D. in wildlife ecology, quantitative ecology, statistics or related field.

ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nResearch Project: The project centers on exploring the challenges of managing plant diseases caused by phytoplasma and spiroplasma infections, with the aim of finding effective solutions. These bacteria lack cell walls and can penetrate plant phloem sieve cells, leading to serious diseases in key crops such as citrus and corn. Early diagnosis and sensitive pathogen detection are essential for successful disease management. Therefore, this study seeks to identify molecular and physiological markers that can improve early detection of phytoplasmas, ultimately helping to reduce phytoplasma-related diseases.\n\nLearning Objectives: Under the guidance of a mentor, the fellow will have the opportunity to learn how to:\n\nGain insights into the unique genomic and pathological features of phytoplasmas and spiroplasmas\nExplore the physiological signals and gene pathways that regulate phytoplasma virulence and plant defense\nSelect and evaluate appropriate molecular markers for detecting phytoplasmas and spiroplasmas during the early stages of the disease\nMentor(s): The mentor for this opportunity is Wei Wei (wei.wei@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor(s).\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: September 1, 2025. Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be renewed upon recommendation of ARS and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $45,000 - $85,000 annually.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens only.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS. Participants do not become employees of USDA, ARS, DOE or the program administrator, and there are no employment-related benefits. Proof of health insurance is required for participation in this program. Health insurance can be obtained through ORISE.\n\nQuestions: Please visit our Program Website. After reading, if you have additional questions about the application process, please email ORISE.ARS.Northeast@orau.org and include the reference code for this opportunity.\n\nQualifications\nThe qualified candidate should have received a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree in one of the relevant fields.
