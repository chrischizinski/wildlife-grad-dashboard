We seek an enthusiastic and self-motivated student who can work independently while participating in a fun and highly collaborative lab environment, and encourage interested students to read through our Mission Statement, Code of Conduct, and other lab resources posted on our website (https://carey.biol.vt.edu) to learn more about our group.\n We are recruiting a Ph.D. student interested in measuring, modeling, and forecasting how reservoir water quality is changing. Research areas could include phytoplankton dynamics and/or carbon biogeochemistry. This project involves field sampling with other graduate students and undergraduate assistants as part of a long-term freshwater monitoring program; and co-developing water quality models and forecasts with managers and the public to guide decision-making. \n The Ph.D. student would work with our interdisciplinary, highly-collaborative team in the Center for Ecosystem Forecasting at Virginia Tech; both positions include opportunities for co-advising and environmental modeling and data science training with Quinn Thomas. Throughout their dissertation, the student would work closely with managers, educators, and the public at our focal reservoir sites in Virginia and other waterbodies. \n Successful applicants will: be excited to dig into the mysteries of lake and reservoir water quality; have research and scientific writing experience through previous employment and/or education; enjoy liaising with managers and the public; and be excited to join a collaborative team. Candidates who are enthusiastic about expanding their quantitative skillset are especially encouraged to apply.\n The Carey Lab is committed to upholding and supporting Virginia Tech’s Principles of Community. Our lab actively uses best practices from the science of team science to enable our collaborative work in a supportive environment and inspire each other to grow as leaders, educators, and innovators. We welcome applications from candidates with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.\n The Carey Lab is part of the Virginia Tech Stream Team, an internationally-recognized group of faculty and students studying the ecology of aquatic habitats. This vibrant research group provides an ideal environment for conducting graduate work within an interactive and supportive community of freshwater and ecosystem scientists (https://vtstreamteam.weebly.com). Other opportunities for students in the Carey Lab include participating in the Virginia Tech Interfaces of Global Change graduate training program (https://www.globalchange.vt.edu/igc/) and Center for Communicating Science (https://communicatingscience.isce.vt.edu).\n The position is supported by National Science Foundation grants and will be funded on a combination of research and teaching assistantships, which include a competitive stipend, tuition waiver, and health insurance benefits. Our Ph.D. program guarantees five years of funding, including summers. \n Interested students should send an email letter of inquiry to Cayelan (cayelan @ vt.edu). Please include: 1) an overview of your research interests, 2) a short description of why you are interested in joining our specific lab, 3) your C.V. or résumé, 4) an unofficial transcript, and 5) contact info for three references. Please feel free to contact Cayelan with questions about the application process, graduate school at Virginia Tech, or potential research opportunities. \n Timeline: I generally interview prospective students who email me that are well-aligned with the lab group and available funding via video teleconferences throughout September-November and then will invite competitive applicants to submit their materials for a December 1 admission deadline. If possible, I encourage you to email me by November 1. We no longer require GRE scores as part of our application process.

Our lab actively uses best practices from the science of team science to enable our collaborative work in a supportive environment and inspire each other to grow as leaders, educators, and innovators. We welcome applications from candidates with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.\n The Carey Lab is part of the Virginia Tech Stream Team, an internationally-recognized group of faculty and students studying the ecology of aquatic habitats. This vibrant research group provides an ideal environment for conducting graduate work within an interactive and supportive community of freshwater and ecosystem scientists (https://vtstreamteam.weebly.com). Other opportunities for students in the Carey Lab include participating in the Virginia Tech Interfaces of Global Change graduate training program (https://www.globalchange.vt.edu/igc/) and Center for Communicating Science (https://communicatingscience.isce.vt.edu).\n The position is supported by National Science Foundation grants and will be funded on a combination of research and teaching assistantships, which include a competitive stipend, tuition waiver, and health insurance benefits. Our Ph.D. program guarantees five years of funding, including summers. \n Interested students should send an email letter of inquiry to Cayelan (cayelan @ vt.edu). Please include: 1) an overview of your research interests, 2) a short description of why you are interested in joining our specific lab, 3) your C.V. or résumé, 4) an unofficial transcript, and 5) contact info for three references. Please feel free to contact Cayelan with questions about the application process, graduate school at Virginia Tech, or potential research opportunities. \n Timeline: I generally interview prospective students who email me that are well-aligned with the lab group and available funding via video teleconferences throughout September-November and then will invite competitive applicants to submit their materials for a December 1 admission deadline. If possible, I encourage you to email me by November 1. We no longer require GRE scores as part of our application process.

The position will preferably begin in January of 2026, but alternative start dates may be possible. \n\nProject Description: \nThe project will study patterns of occupancy and abundance of Kirtland’s Warbler, Common Nighthawk, Eastern Whip-poor-will, Spruce Grouse, and Ruffed Grouse on sites managed for the warbler. To determine how occupancy and abundance vary with site- and landscape-level factors, we will integrate acoustic data collected via autonomous recording units and vegetation surveys from across the Kirtland’s Warbler breeding range with remote sensing data to build models that predict habitat characteristics that optimize abundance across species. Our research will produce recommendations on how best to manage and create habitat within Kirtland’s Warbler Management Areas and will also highlight where to prioritize restoration projects - all with the goal of creating optimal Kirtland’s Warbler habitat while maximizing avian species richness and recreation (i.e., hunting) opportunity. \nThe Ph.D. student will be supported on a combination of Graduate Research Assistantships and Graduate Teaching Assistantships for the duration of the degree (5 years). The position includes a tuition waiver and monthly stipend (currently $2,848/month). Travel during fieldwork and other associated research costs will also be funded. \n Required Qualifications: \nCandidates for this position must possess a minimum of a Bachelor of Science degree (Master of Science strongly preferred) in Wildlife, Biology, Zoology, or a related field. Furthermore, they must have an academic transcript commensurate with acceptance to the graduate program in Fisheries and Wildlife in the School of Environment and Natural Resources (https://senr.osu.edu/graduate/admissions). \nThis project will generate a large amount of data for analysis, thus in addition to prior field work experience, we are seeking a student with excellent quantitative skills and experience with GIS. Therefore, the successful candidate will have experience working with Program R, ArcGIS or other GIS software, multiple years of experience in field ecology, the ability and willingness to work long hours independently in the field, and a valid drivers license. \n Preferred Qualifications: \nAdditional desirable qualifications include experience in programming languages in addition to R , experience working with autonomous recording units (ARUs) and associated data, experience conducting vegetation surveys, and bird identification skills. \n  To apply: \nEmail a 1-page cover letter outlining your interest in and qualifications for the position, C.V., unofficial academic transcript, and contact information for 3 references to Chris Tonra (tonra.1@osu.edu).  Applications will be considered as they are received until the position is filled.  \n\nContact\nChristopher M Tonra\ntonra.1@osu.edu (preferred contact method)",
