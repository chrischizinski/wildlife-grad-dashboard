ARS will deliver cutting-edge, scientific tools and innovative solutions for American farmers, producers, industry, and communities to support the nourishment and well-being of all people; sustain our nation’s agroecosystems and natural resources; and ensure the economic competitiveness and excellence of our agriculture. The vision of the agency is to provide global leadership in agricultural discoveries through scientific excellence.\n\nThe SCINet/Big Data Research Participation Program of the USDA ARS offers research opportunities to motivated postdoctoral fellows interested in solving agriculture-related problems at a range of spatial and temporal scales, from the genome to the continent, and sub-daily to evolutionary time scales. One of the goals of the SCINet Initiative is to develop and apply new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, to help solve complex agricultural problems that also depend on collaboration across scientific disciplines and geographic locations. In addition, many of these technologies rely on the synthesis, integration, and analysis of large, diverse datasets that benefit from high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. The objective of these fellowships is to facilitate cross-disciplinary, cross-location research through collaborative research on problems of interest to each applicant and amenable to or requiring the HPC environment. Training will be provided in data science, scientific computing, AI/machine learning, and related topics as needed for the fellow to complete their research. Additional funds are available for supplies and travel essential for the fellow's research.\n\nResearch Project: Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will research towards developing iterative forecasts for the spread of a viral arthropod-borne livestock disease from Mexico into the United States. Vesicular Stomatitis (VS) has a complex ecology with multiple vector species, host species, and a wide geographic range, occurring every year in southern Mexico and semi-periodically spreading northwards to cause outbreaks in the western US. We lack timely forecasts of direction and rate of disease spread during an outbreak event.  \n\nModeling approaches will feature process-based machine learning in high-performance computing (HPC) environments and include data assimilation techniques in a Bayesian framework. Under the guidance of a mentor, the participant will identify and integrate multiple data streams into the model framework, including host and vector distributions, confirmed georeferenced reports of VS cases in the United States and Mexico, and publicly available environmental layers derived from satellites, observational networks, and reanalysis products.  \n\nThe forecasting model time lag will be paired with the time periods needed for impactful management activity (e.g., increased livestock monitoring, vector surveillance, animal movement and quarantines) at relevant spatial scales. The participant will collaboratively produce forecasts of VS disease emergence and spread meant to be updated iteratively over the outbreak season, with explicit quantification of forecast uncertainty. Findings from this project can be applied to other arthropod-borne disease systems. The participant will also have the opportunity to contribute open and reproducible high-performance computational workflows to the ARS SCINet and AI Center of Excellence (scinet.usda.gov) communities. \n\nLearning Objectives: The participant will learn about developing stakeholder-driven models of livestock disease spread that are widely applicable to a broad range of systems. The participant will also have the opportunity to take online courses and other trainings in coding (e.g., R, Python, HPC) and scientific topics, and to hone interdisciplinary communication, collaboration, and leadership skills through workshop and working group experiences.  \n\nUSDA-ARS Contact: If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact Dr. Amy Hudson at amy.hudson@usda.gov. \n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: Start date is flexible, anticipated in January 2026. \n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for one year but may be renewed for a second year upon recommendation of the mentor and ARS. \n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is full-time. \n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant(s) will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The current stipend range for this opportunity is $90,000 - $100,000/year plus a supplement to offset a health insurance premium. \n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR). \n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and ARS.

Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship work supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates their work across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: working in collaboration with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: Natural ecosystems are becoming homogenized by the introduction and establishment of non-native species.  Our study area, the lowland wet forests (LWF) of Hawai‘i, have been subject to high rates of invasion due to geography and human colonization.  However, non-native species removal is expensive and time-consuming, and some non-native species may be playing important roles in the community by providing ecosystem goods and services. The Liko Na Pilina Project seeks to develop a strategy utilizing the functional traits of plants to purposefully create new ecosystems that maintain themselves with relatively little input, and that are capable of sequestering substantial amounts of carbon, sustaining a broad range of native biological diversity, and staying open enough at ground level to allow human movement through them. Our overall objective is to develop and evaluate a set of what we call “hybrid ecosystems,” in which a mix of native and non-native species maintains valuable forest structure and ecosystem services. The participant will support this Liko Na Pilina restoration experiment and be mentored as part of a collaborative team of the USDA Forest Service, University of Hawaii at Hilo, and the Hawaii Army National Guard. \n\nThe participant will be involved with field data collections, field research plot maintenance, greenhouse planting, laboratory sample processing, and data entry. Field data collections are focused on:\n\nCollecting data on tree growth and survival, seed production, litterfall, and phenology;\nConducting regular plot maintenance (weeding and herbicide application), and;\nPlanting desirable species mixes into target restoration areas across the larger landscape.\nGreenhouse plantings will focus on:\n\nPropagation of desirable plants of future restoration efforts, and;\nGeneral upkeep of the greenhouse space. \nLaboratory sample processing will focus on: post-processing (i.e., sorting and weighing) litterfall/seed rain samples. Data entry will focus on entering data collected in the field and lab into ongoing data sets.\n\nField conditions can be hot or rainy. Terrain is very uneven as plots are located on 'a'a lava substrates. Day to day activities of the participant will involve hiking and standing and may include lifting containers weighing up to 35 pounds. \n\nLearning Objectives: The fellow will build knowledge, experience, and competence in the following areas:\n\nPlant identification and vegetation monitoring techniques\nApplied hands-on restoration strategies\nPlant propagation technique for species with diverse needs\nStandard ecological sample processing protocols \nData entry, management, and analysis\nMentor: The mentor for this opportunity is Susan Cordell (susan.cordell@usda.gov). If you have questions about the nature of the research, please contact the mentor.\n\nAnticipated Appointment Start Date: October 2025.  Start date is flexible and will depend on a variety of factors.\n\nAppointment Length: The appointment will initially be for 10 months but may be extended upon recommendation of USDA Forest Service and is contingent on the availability of funds.\n\nLevel of Participation: The appointment is part time.\n\nParticipant Stipend: The participant will receive a monthly stipend commensurate with educational level and experience. The anticipated stipend range is $1646.67 - $1,820.00 monthly.\n\nCitizenship Requirements: This opportunity is available to U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR), and foreign nationals. Non-U.S. citizen applicants should refer to the Guidelines for Non-U.S. Citizens Details page of the program website for information about the valid immigration statuses that are acceptable for program participation.\n\nORISE Information: This program, administered by ORAU through its contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manage the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE), was established through an interagency agreement between DOE and USDA Forest Service.
