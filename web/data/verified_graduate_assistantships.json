Nonparasitic lampreys have repeatedly evolved from parasitic species that feed on the blood of fish hosts. This shift in life history represents a loss of a complex trait, where nonparasitic lampreys transition directly from larvae into reproductive adults without developing the apparatus or appetite for parasitic feeding. The goal of this project is to understand the genomic and developmental basis of parasitism versus nonparasitism in the silver lamprey (I. unicuspis) and northern brook lamprey (I. fossor), two closely related ecotypes with ongoing gene flow in the Laurentian Great Lakes. The selected student will lead a collaborative project with two primary components: 1) a common garden study in which full reciprocal crosses of Iu and If will be raised at the US Geological Survey’s Hammond Bay Biological Station (HBBS) in Millersburg, MI and sampled for transcriptomic and phenotypic analysis across key stages of larval development through metamorphosis into reproductive adults (nonparasitic If) or parasitic juveniles (Iu); and 2) a population genomics study in which whole genomes will be sequenced for groups of each species from multiple streams where they co-occur. These genomes will then be used to identify genomic regions that consistently differ between ecotypes. The selected student will lead all aspects of the project, including lamprey and sample collection, assessment of reproductive and trophic phenotypes, transcriptomic and genomic analyses, writing reports, and publishing results in scientific journals. Support and training will be provided by the PI (T Buchinger) and co-PIs at MSU (J Hume and Y-W Chung-Davidson), USGS (N Johnson), University of Manitoba (M Docker), and University of Glasgow (A Jacobs). The student may also have opportunities to develop other projects that leverage research facilities at HBBS and the Genomics and Chemical Ecology Laboratory at MSU.  \n Qualifications: B.Sc. or M.Sc. (preferred) in biology, evolutionary biology, bioinformatics, genomics, or a related field. Experience or interest in fieldwork, morphology, and bioinformatics. \n Location: Primary location is MSU (East Lansing, MI) with regular sampling trips (~3 days each) to HBBS (Millersburg, MI), lamprey sampling throughout the Great Lakes region, and the opportunity for a visit (~3 months) to University of Glasgow (Glasgow, Scotland) to work with Co-PI Jacobs on analysis of genomics data. \n Start date: March-June 2026.\n Stipend: ~$35,000/ year; health insurance and tuition waiver. Funding is expected for 4.5 years. \n To Apply: Send a letter of interest including a brief summary of background and qualifications and a CV to Tyler Buchinger (buching6@msu.edu). \n Review of applications will begin 17 Nov 2025 and continue until the position is filled. \nContact\nTyler Buchinger\nbuching6@msu.edu (preferred contact method)",

The study will take place on private or publicly-owned forest sites in parts of western and northern Mississippi, and possibly southwestern Tennessee or northern Alabama. This will be a new study that will focus on establishing baseline distribution and abundance of priority species for upland hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood systems identified in the East Gulf Coastal Plain Joint Venture landbird plan. The student will also collect data on forest structure and surrounding landscape conditions to establish habitat associations in these systems. Field work under this study will take place late Spring-Summer 2026 and 2027 and may include auditory/visual bird surveys, exploration of Autonomous Recording Units as a survey mechanism, and comprehensive forest overstory and understory cover surveys. The extent of field work will depend on availability of funds. The student will interact closely with partners in the East Gulf Coastal Plain Joint Venture, which represents an active partnership among federal and state wildlife agencies, non-profit organizations, and others with an expressed dedication to bird conservation in the region. If interested, the student will also have the opportunity to evaluate alignment of field-based forest structural metrics with satellite-based LiDAR measures to improve the ability for extrapolation of LiDAR data to applied forest management needs. The student will also be part of the Quantitative Ecology and Spatial Technologies Lab (https://www.quest.fwrc.msstate.edu/) at Mississippi State University, which is a is a research consortium of spatial and quantitative ecologists dedicated to the management and conservation of wildlife from individuals to communities and their associated landscapes. The position will require strong quantitative skills and strong field skills, along with the ability to work and think independently. The position will also require strong writing skills for proposal and thesis/publication development.  Data will be used to help inform/update desired forest structural conditions for birds in upland hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood systems. Field housing will be provided on or near sites. Per requirements of departmental funding, the student will be required to serve as a Teaching Assistant in one departmental course each semester, except for their graduating semester.\n\nQualifications: B.S. degree in wildlife and fisheries science, biological sciences, forest ecology, natural resource science, conservation biology, or other related fields with GPA >3.0. Student must be self-motivated, safety-oriented, able to work independently during very early-morning hours in hot and humid weather conditions, and have at least introductory experience with quantitative analysis in program R (or equivalent) and with scientific writing.  Experience working in field conditions in remote areas/rural landscapes preferred. Experience conducting research on passerine birds, monitoring in upland forest landscapes, and/or programming data analysis in R a plus. To apply please email the following materials to Kristine Evans (kristine.evans@msstate.edu) with a subject line as follows (YOURNAME_UplandHardwoodMSAssistantship), and attachments including: 1) a cover letter describing interest and professional goals; 2) a resume; 3) contact information for three references; 4) copies of academic transcripts (unofficial okay), and 5) GRE scores (if available) by  no later than November 14, 2025 (sooner is better).

Trillions of organisms live, forage, and migrate through this vast aerial environment—yet it is rarely treated as a primary habitat for ecological or conservation prioritization. Despite its perceived lack of structure, the airspace serves as a global conduit for the movement of biomass, weather, and inorganic materials. Increasing pollution and the proliferation of human-made structures are rapidly transforming this habitat, underscoring the urgent need for fundamental research to address core questions in population and community ecology.\n\nThis PhD project in the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources at Purdue University (https://ag.purdue.edu/department/fnr/index.html) aims to understand how airspaces are ecologically organized by examining species occupancy, niche structure, predator–prey dynamics, and morphological adaptation. The lower atmosphere tightly links distant terrestrial and aquatic systems through the transfer of biotic and abiotic resources, forming a rich but largely unseen network of organisms.\n\nAeroecology, the study of airborne life and its use of the lower atmosphere, offers a unique lens for exploring these dynamics. Using aerial insectivores, specifically Purple Martins, as a model system, this work will test three complementary hypotheses grounded in community ecology:\n\n1.     Niche Packing Hypothesis – How do species partition aerial space and resources?\n2.     Morphology-Driven Niche Hypothesis – How do traits shape the ecological roles of airborne species?\n3.     Tracking Aerial Resources Hypothesis – How do species follow and respond to the movement of aerial prey?\n\nBy integrating radar and barometric pressure transmitters with ecological theory, this project will reveal the organization and dynamics of communities that inhabit our planet’s aerial ecosystems, offering transformative insights into one of Earth’s last unexplored habitats.\n\nQualifications: The candidate is expected to have completed a master’s degree in a related field (Biology, Ecology, Wildlife Ecology) prior to starting the position in August 2026. The student should have experience in R coding, geospatial analysis, avian ecology, bird handling and banding, comfort deploying radio tags (or similar technology), and a record in disseminating research findings, including presentations and peer-reviewed publications. \n To Apply: Please send your application to Kyle Horton (kghorton@purdue.edu) containing a Cover Letter, CV, and contact information of three references.  Within your cover letter, please reflect on how your experiences lend to this project, why you are interested in this project, and how this degree helps fulfill your career aspirations.
