Persistence of alpine avifauna will depend upon the ability of individuals to seek out microhabitats that provide cool refugia while engaging in behaviors that reduce energy expenditure. Identifying such microclimate refugia and understanding how alpine birds use them will help inform management strategies for conserving alpine ecosystems in the face of rapid temperature warming. This funded PhD project focuses on two focal species, Rock Ptarmigan and Rock Partridge, using state-of-the-art GPS tracking technology to quantify fine-scale movement patterns, as well as climate monitoring at study sites and land surface temperature mapping using a thermal drone. The project is located in the Swiss Alps and has completed two field seasons, with fieldwork projected to continue for an additional 1-2 years. \n\nThe successful PhD Candidate will have access to the full study data set, with the opportunity to develop new field and/or analytical components depending upon logistics, expertise and interest. The Candidate must hold a MSc degree in biology or equivalent and ideally will show a strong interest in conservation science, environmental management and spatial analyses. \n\nAdditional preferred (but not required) skills include: field experience studying birds or other vertebrates in montane landscapes, strong quantitative background with ability and interest to rapidly gain new skillsets related to the joint analysis of animal movement, climate, and remote sensing data, and knowledge of French and/or German. \n\nThe project will be co-advised as a collaboration between Prof. Dr. Raphaël Arlettaz at University of Bern Division of Conservation Biology (Switzerland) and Assistant Professor Dr. Ian Ausprey at Texas A&M University Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology (USA). The Candidate will spend the first year at Uni Bern and the second two years at Texas A&M University and must be willing and able to commit to this schedule (exact timing negotiable). The PhD will be defended and granted at Uni Bern. \n\nStart: January 2026. Duration: 3 years, with possible prolongation. Salary according to SNSF rules. \n\nApplications must be submitted to ian.ausprey@ag.tamu.edu and should include a motivation letter describing your interests, experience and relevance for this position, a CV (including a list of publications if available), abstract of MSc thesis, and contact information for three professional references (institution, email, and phone number).\n\nThe application deadline is September 7th, 2025, with online interviews during the second half of September 2025.\n\nContact\nDr. Ian Ausprey\nian.ausprey@ag.tamu.edu (preferred contact method)",

The focal project will be to sample arthropods from high-elevation sites in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma, employ high-throughput DNA barcoding methods to uncover biodiversity patterns, and relate those patterns to environmental variables and ecosystem function.  Prospective applicants should have research interests in entomology, ecology, and evolutionary biology, and should have strong field, lab, and analytical skills.  Applicants with previous experience using molecular techniques (e.g., PCR, NGS library preparation, metabarcoding, etc.) and bioinformatics are preferred.  Experience with GIS and/or R is also desirable. \n Financial support will be provided through a combination of teaching and research assistantships.  Assistantships come with a full tuition (not fees) waiver and 67% of the student health insurance paid for by the university.  The selected applicant would need to be admitted to a Ph.D. program at the University of Arkansas for the Spring 2026 semester, which begins January 12, 2026.  Students admitted to a Ph.D. program may also be eligible for a U of A Doctoral Fellowship that adds to their assistantship stipend for 4 years.  More information about these fellowships can be found at: https://graduate-students.uark.edu/cost-and-funding/index.php.  Note that applications for these fellowships require the GRE General Test even if it is not required for admission to a graduate program.  Applicants who would be competitive for a doctoral fellowship will be viewed favorably.  Continued support will be contingent on satisfactory performance and progress. \n Research in the Forest Ecology & Health Lab uses field experiments and naturally occurring environmental gradients to examine how biogeochemistry and nutrients impact community structure and trophic interactions among soil arthropods and ant species primarily in forest ecosystems.  This project is in collaboration with Dr. Donald Shepard in the University of Arkansas, Department of Biological Sciences, and Dr. Ashley Dowling in the University of Arkansas, Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology.  More information about their research and labs can be found at: https://shepardlab.wixsite.com/home and https://adowling.hosted.uark.edu/index.html.  Information about the Ph.D. in Entomology program and its requirements is provided here: https://enpl.uark.edu/programs/phd-program.php. Depending on their interests and goals, the selected applicant may have the option to apply through the Ph.D. in Biology program: https://biology.uark.edu/academics/graduate/index.php. \n To apply, send an email to Dr. Natalie Clay (nclay@uark.edu) that includes as attachments: 1) a cover letter expressing your interest and highlighting your qualifications for the position as well as your future career goals, 2) your curriculum vitae, 3) an unofficial copy of your college transcripts, and 4) names and contact information for three professional references.  To receive full consideration, submit your application by August 1, 2025; however, applications will be considered until the position is filled.  Note: the selected applicant will still need to apply to and be accepted into a Ph.D. program at the University of Arkansas.  The application deadline for Spring 2026 admission is September 1 for Entomology and October 1 for Biology.

Our research focuses on quantifying vegetation dynamics over space and time and identifying how the relative importance of ecological processes structuring plant communities changes with spatial and temporal scale. In addition, a key goal of our research is to understand how pattern and process in plant communities will be altered in the face of global environmental change. An important motivation for our work is to address ecological questions at large spatial scales to inform landscape conservation. We collect field data, use existing large observational data sets, and implement simulation modeling to address these goals in temperate shrublands, wetlands, woodlands, and forests. Additional information about the lab can be found at http://www.kylepalmquist.org/.\n RESEARCH FOCUS: The successful candidate will explore the interacting effects of sea-level rise and increased storm surge on coastal vegetation and the effects of prescribed fire on pine-dominated vegetation on Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island (MCRDPI), a sea-island in South Carolina. Coastal vegetation provides important ecosystem services, including storm protection, erosion control, and habitat for wildlife. These complex, highly zoned plant communities are structured by multiple environmental factors including salinity, elevation, soil texture, soil moisture, exposure, and light availability. Sea-level rise and intensification of the hydrologic cycle (i.e. more frequent and intense storms) is expected to affect the distribution and composition of coastal vegetation in the future, with important implications. Prescribed fire has been implemented in pine woodlands and forests on the island to enhance their resilience to climate change and to restore their structure from closed forests to open woodlands. The effects of prescribed fire have yet to be assessed. The project will integrate remote sensing, plant community sampling, and modeling to quantify how sea-level rise and associated factors have impacted coastal vegetation up to present and how climate change may influence vegetation in the future. An additional goal is to assess how prescribed fire is influencing pine-dominated vegetation on the island by installing and re-sampling permanent vegetation plots.   \n PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS: A background, including relevant course work, in botany or plant ecology, and GIS or remote sensing, strong communication skills, and strong quantitative skills. Experience in remote sensing and GIS and knowledge of the southeastern US flora is highly desirable.\n EXPECTATIONS: The successful candidate will be expected to conduct high-quality research, serve as a teaching assistant within the Department of Biological Sciences, present their research to the scientific community at regional and national meetings, and publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n TIMELINE: The position is available starting January 2026 and possibly before.\n FUNDING: Funding will consist of a combination of research and teaching assistantships for two years. A 12-month competitive stipend ($20,000), and full tuition waiver will be provided. The student is responsible for covering University fees.\n HOW TO APPLY: Interested students should apply by submitting the following to Dr. Kyle Palmquist (palmquist@marshall.edu): 1) short statement of research interests and career goals (no longer than 1 page), 2) CV, 3) unofficial transcripts, and 4) contact information for three professional references. Please include: “MS position – coastal vegetation” and your name in the email subject.\n Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until a candidate is selected. I will contact you to discuss your research interests and goals for graduate school if I determine you would be a good fit for the lab. If selected, a full application must be submitted to the Department of Biological Sciences at Marshall University, Huntington, WV. Faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences have expertise in a variety of biological fields, including but not limited to ecology, evolution, herpetology, and physiology. More information about the Department and its programs can be found here: https://www.marshall.edu/biology/. Application requirements for admission to the DBS graduate program can be found here: https://www.marshall.edu/biology/admission/.\n Marshall University is located in Huntington, an affordable college town located on the Ohio River in the beautiful state of West Virginia. The town is small enough to get around on foot and bike, but large enough to support a variety of restaurants and other cultural activities. Huntington and the surrounding area offer ample recreational opportunities (hiking, skiing, rafting), along with proximity to larger cities, including Louisville, KY, Cincinnati, OH, and Columbus, OH. In the Palmquist Lab, we highly value and encourage work-life balance. \n I strongly encourage students from diverse backgrounds and experiences to apply. Feel free to contact me with questions at any time.\n \nContact\nKyle Palmquist\npalmquist@marshall.edu (preferred contact method)",

Everything they do is intended to help sustain forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Why? Because their stewardship supports nature in sustaining life. This is the purpose that drives the agency’s mission and motivates across the agency. It’s been there from the agency’s very beginning, and it still drives them. To advance the mission and serve their purpose, the USDA Forest Service balances the short and long-term needs of people and nature by: collaborating with communities and our partners; providing access to resources and experiences that promote economic, ecological, and social vitality; connecting people to the land and one another; and delivering world-class science, technology and land management.\n\nResearch Project: Wildland fires emit a wide variety of trace gases and aerosols which are harmful to human health. When wildfires occur, millions of people may be exposed to unhealthy and sometimes hazardous air quality conditions, often for days or weeks. Yet, wildland fire is also a natural part of many ecosystems. Prescribed burning is used in various regions of the US to maintain ecosystem health, as well as a means of protecting people and resources from wildfire.\n\nWe are looking for a fellow to participate in a project that seeks to substantially upgrade and expand the suite of tools available for documenting and forecasting wildland fire smoke transport and dispersion. The project objective is to improve both wildfire and prescribed fire operational decision support in various landscapes. They will interact with a team focused on developing new systems and novel techniques and tools, such as improving smoke modeling systems through a variety of means.

We achieve this by hiring people who share a passion for justice and a healthy environment. We wield the power of law and the strength of partnership to protect people’s health; preserve magnificent places and wildlife; advance clean energy; and combat climate change. We partner with thousands of groups and supporters to take on the biggest, most precedent-setting cases across the country and have a distinguished track record of achieving significant, lasting environmental protections. We are here because the earth needs a good lawyer.\n\n\nEarthjustice’s work is currently divided into three major areas:\n\nLands, Wildlife, and Oceans focuses on cases that protect endangered species, national forests, national parks, other public lands, water resources, and the oceans.\nHealthy Communities focuses on cases that protect public health, prevent air and water pollution, and curb exposures to toxic chemicals, particularly in disproportionately impacted communities. Recently, our healthy communities work has also begun to promote sustainable food and agriculture and the rights of farm workers.\nClimate and Energy focuses on cases that encourage the swift and just transition to clean energy while challenging the reliance on coal, oil, and other dirty fuels.\n\nWe welcome all interested law students from across the country to apply for a summer law clerk position. We expect that students will work proximate to or in an office where the program is located. In some limited instances, an office may hire clerks to work in an area that is outside that team’s geographic area, but still proximate to an Earthjustice office.\n\n\nPlease note the location preferences of each litigation team in their descriptions below.\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\nSummer law clerks will have the opportunity to work with several attorneys on case development and litigation strategy. Students may draft pleadings and briefs, do legal research, develop strategy and legal theories, gather evidence, and attend client meetings and court proceedings. Earthjustice’s summer law clerk program also includes various programmatic offerings, such as in-person and virtual seminars with attorneys and guest speakers on current environmental issues, interactions with other local and regional environmental groups, and a job interview workshop.\n\n\nCompensation\n\n\nEarthjustice summer law clerkships are paid positions. The total stipend amount will be dependent on any external funding a student secures, such as through their law school’s summer funding program. Earthjustice will provide a one-time stipend at the start of the clerkship in the amount of $1,320.00 per week, minus the total amount received from any other sources and applicable taxes. The summer law clerkship is designed to be 10 weeks long at full-time hours (37.5 hours/week).\n\n\nYou are welcome to pursue outside funding. The ability to secure outside funding will not be considered as part of the hiring process.\n\n\nHow to Apply\n\n\nEligibility: Candidates must be enrolled in a U.S. law school through fall 2026 (i.e., not graduating before December 2026) and be available to commit to 10 weeks during summer 2026. Summer law clerks must work from the U.S. during their clerkship.\n\n\nEach Earthjustice litigation team participates in clerk hiring; candidates may submit applications to whichever and however many litigation teams they are interested. Please be prepared to respond to our September follow-up e-mail, requesting your ranked choice of the teams for which you have applied. Do not include such rankings within your Jobvite application.\n\n\nContact\nHR\ncontact via the web posting is preferred (see Details section)",
