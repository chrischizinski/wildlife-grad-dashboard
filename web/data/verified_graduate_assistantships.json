Introduced and invasive species are some of the greatest risks to conservation and management of native fishes. Stocking sterile fishes that are highly predatory (e.g., Tiger Muskellunge, triploid Walleye) is increasingly popular to control populations of undesirable fishes while maintaining the long-term goals of native species conservation. However, stocking of these sterile predators may not be compatible with other management activities. The successful candidate will design and conduct research to develop a set of best practices when using Tiger Muskellunge as biological control. Research components may include harmonizing long-term Colorado State data, field-based experiments, gut content and stable isotope analyses, bioenergetic modeling, population modeling, angler surveys, and quantitative literature review.

Coyotes have relatively recently colonized the southeast, taking on the role of the largest carnivore across much of the region and exerting top-down effects on the native large herbivore (white-tailed deer) and other trophic levels. At the same time, wild pigs have spread across much of the southeast, and our recent research suggests they are impacting predator-prey dynamics in this system. However, disentangling the relative effects of coyotes and wild pigs individually on ecosystem processes has heretofore been limited due to the fact that both species occur ubiquitously across any area where they co-occur, i.e., studying the effects of one species in isolation from the other has been impossible. Therefore, with state and federal partners, we will be using large (100 acre) exclosures that will selectively exclude each of these target species. \n\nThe student is expected to take part in this exciting new project (exclosures were just constructed) by developing research questions related specifically to deer and other mammalian responses to our experimental design. Within the study area we are placing GPS tracking collars on coyotes, deer and wild pigs, allowing the student to investigate questions regarding how removal of predation risk and/or risk of interacting with the dominant competitor (i.e., wild pigs) impact deer movement behavior, stress physiology, maternal care and fawn survival. We also have an extensive camera trap array and drift fences in place, making the system well suited to assess community-level responses by carnivores and other trophic levels. \n\nApplicants are required to have an MS in wildlife ecology or a related field, previous experience in studying the ecology of wildlife in a field setting, be a US citizen and have a valid US driver’s license. Top applicants will have a strong interest in the ecology of large mammals and their impact on other trophic levels, as well as evidence of strong scientific writing and basic statistics.  Applicants should submit a cover letter, CV, contact information for 3 references, unofficial transcripts, and a scientific writing sample as a single PDF titled “LastName_PhDapplication” to djachow@clemson.edu prior to September 22, 2025.  The selected student would start at Clemson in January 2026. \n\nThe selected student will be awarded a 4-year graduate research assistantship (starting at $30,000/year, health benefits, along with tuition waiver) to attend Clemson University as a Fellow in the Clemson Boone and Crockett University Program. As a Boone and Crockett Fellow, the student will join a network of fellows at other universities with Boone and Crockett Programs and have access to several exclusive professional development opportunities. The student will be advised by Dr. David Jachowski within the Department of Forestry and Wildlife Conservation, with external advising from Dr. John Kilgo of the U.S. Forest Service. Clemson University is the largest public land grant university in the state of South Carolina and nationally recognized as an R1 (“very high research activity”) institution.
