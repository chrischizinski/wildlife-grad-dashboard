South Campus Dr. (Tucson, Arizona)\nTags:\nGraduate Opportunities\nDescription\nPhD Student Opportunity: Fall 2026. The Tigreros Lab is recruiting a highly motivated PhD student to study the intricate ways environmental stress shapes life histories, behavior, and species interactions in insect herbivores. Our research is fundamentally integrative and interdisciplinary. We combine advanced controlled laboratory techniques (e.g., metabolic assays, stable isotope tracing) with field studies in natural and agricultural systems.\n\nStudents will have the flexibility and support to develop independent research projects. Areas of potential investigation include:\n\n·         Stress and Life-History Strategies: How nutritional and climatic stressors mediate critical life history trade-offs (e.g., dispersal vs. reproduction, offspring number vs. quality).\n·         Carry-over and Maternal Effects: Analyzing the long-term impact of early-life environmental stress on adult traits and the fitness of subsequent generations.\n·         Multi-Stressors and Adaptation: Comparative and population-level studies investigating phenotypic plasticity and adaptation to multiple, interacting stressors (e.g., nutritional, thermal, and predation threats).\n·         Insecticides and Non-Target Organisms: Determining the lasting effects and underlying mechanisms by which common insecticides impact non-target insects, including pollinators and predators.\n\nWe welcome applicants from diverse backgrounds in ecology, evolutionary biology, physiology, or entomology. Ideal candidates will have a passion for quantitative, interdisciplinary research that combines both lab and field methods.\n\nTo Apply: To express your interest, please email Dr. Natasha Tigreros (ntm@arizona.edu).

MS Concentrations include Conservation Biology, Environmental Education, Advocacy for Social Justice and Sustainability, and several others. In Conservation Biology, students focus on gaining quantitative (GIS and statistics), writing, and ecological field skills. Students also gain experience with community engagement, social justice, and applied research and service. \n\nStudents can earn their graduate degree with either face-to-face classes at the Antioch University New England campus in Keene, NH, USA, or fully online classes (that can be taken from anywhere) which are offered each semester, or with a mixture of the two. Ecological field trip classes (intensive 1-2 week trips to destinations abroad and in-country) are also available for all students. All classes are just 1-2 days a week, making this a viable program for environmental professionals working part or full-time. Our programs are student-centered, flexible, and tailored to meet your individual needs, learning style, and location.\n\nStudents often work with Antioch faculty in our existing research programs. Specifically in our Conservation Biology concentration, we have expertise in vertebrate ecology (e.g., birds, snakes), invertebrate ecology (e.g., estuarine invertebrates, insects), tropical ecology, forest ecology, alpine ecology, marine ecology, and coastal restoration. In some cases, faculty may have extramural funding to support students in seasonal field and lab positions, including research in New England and in the Caribbean. Students who are eligible for US federal work-study can also work part time in various on-campus work-study positions, including Graduate Teaching and Research Assistantships and various positions in our numerous campus centers (e.g., Institute for International Conservation, Spatial Analysis Lab). However, you need to be accepted and taking classes as a graduate student to be eligible for these work-study positions. Students at Antioch generally pay for at least part of their own tuition, but we offer numerous university-wide grants and scholarships, which can help defray tuition costs, and which are detailed here: https://www.antioch.edu/admission-aid/financial-aid/scholarships-and-grants/ . We also work with students to help them apply for external scholarships, fellowships, and research-focused grants.\n\n\nJoin our tight-knit community as we strive to advance social and environmental justice, conserve biodiversity, and mitigate climate change as a department and as a university!

The successful applicant will investigate how disturbances such as hurricanes influence plant composition. The research will leverage available long-term data with new field investigations. The student will be appointed as a Graduate Assistant at University of Central Florida, and the student’s work will be co-sponsored by the Jones Center at Ichauway. Financial support is available for two years, starting in Fall 2026, and includes a stipend ($21,000/year) and tuition waiver. Health insurance is covered by the University of Central Florida for graduate students. The student will be expected to TA during semesters sponsored by UCF (approximately one year of the two year appointment).\n\nProject description: Hurricanes are a powerful but understudied ecological force in the southeastern US, where landscapes have historically been shaped by frequent disturbances. Hurricanes have only recently gained recognition as an ecologically important and recurrent disturbance, with most forests in the Southeast experiencing cyclone-force winds about every six years. Understanding how these storms influence ecosystem structure and function is critical for predicting future dynamics in a region experiencing both intensifying storm regimes and rapid environmental change.\n\nThis proposed research will investigate the long-term impacts of hurricanes on community composition using established long-term monitoring datasets.

The successful applicant will investigate how disturbances such as hurricanes influence plant composition. The research will leverage available long-term data with new field investigations. The student will be appointed as a Graduate Assistant at University of Central Florida, and the student’s work will be co-sponsored by the Jones Center at Ichauway. Financial support is available for two years, starting in Fall 2026, and includes a stipend ($21,000/year) and tuition waiver. Health insurance is covered by the University of Central Florida for graduate students. The student will be expected to TA during semesters sponsored by UCF (approximately one year of the two year appointment).\n\nProject description: Hurricanes are a powerful but understudied ecological force in the southeastern US, where landscapes have historically been shaped by frequent disturbances. Hurricanes have only recently gained recognition as an ecologically important and recurrent disturbance, with most forests in the Southeast experiencing cyclone-force winds about every six years. Understanding how these storms influence ecosystem structure and function is critical for predicting future dynamics in a region experiencing both intensifying storm regimes and rapid environmental change.\n\nThis proposed research will investigate the long-term impacts of hurricanes on community composition using established long-term monitoring datasets. By combining these data with a historical record of hurricane windfields, the student will examine how single or repeated exposure to storms shapes patterns of plant diversity, abundance, and recovery over time.
